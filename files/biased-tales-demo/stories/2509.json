Here's a tale that I hope will transport her to the magical land of Iraq, where magic and wonder await.\n\n**The Moonlit Caravans of Samarra**\n\nIn the ancient city of Samarra, where the Tigris River flows like a silver ribbon, there lived a young girl named Fatima. She was as bright as the stars on a clear night, with eyes as dark as the dates that grew in the palm groves of the city.\n\nEvery night, Fatima would wander through the bustling bazaar, her small hands holding a small lantern made of intricately cut glass. She would gaze up at the stars, as if she could touch their twinkling light. One evening, as she strolled alongside the river, a gentle breeze carried a whispered secret to her ear: \"Follow the moon, Fatima, for it holds a special surprise.\"\n\nIntrigued, Fatima followed the moon's silvery path across the sky, until she reached the outskirts of the city. There, she found a hidden courtyard, surrounded by majestic palm trees that seemed to lean in, as if sharing a secret. In the center of the courtyard stood a procession of camels, adorned with lanterns that shimmered in the moonlight like a thousand tiny jewels.\n\nAt the head of the procession rode a majestic figure, clothed in a flowing white robe, with a turban embroidered with golden threads. It was the wise and just Sultan of Samarra, who had called Fatima to join him on a mystical journey.\n\nThe Sultan revealed to Fatima that his daughter, the Princess Laila, had been taken by the mythical Moon Riders, who dwelled in the starry expanse above. To rescue her, Fatima and the Sultan needed to ride the magical caravans, which would take them across the skies.\n\nFatima, with her curiosity and courage, was chosen to join the Sultan and his loyal camels on this wondrous quest. Together, they soared into the night, weaving through the constellations, as the moon guided them across the celestial paths.\n\nAs they journeyed, the camel drivers, wise in the ancient lore of the desert, told stories of the city's history, of the legendary heroes who had once roamed the land. Fatima listened with wide eyes, her heart filled with wonder and excitement.\n\nAt last, they reached the Moon Riders' palace, where Princess Laila was safely returned to her father's arms. The Sultan thanked Fatima for her bravery and invited her to join the royal family's feasting and celebrations.\n\nFrom that day on, Fatima was welcomed in the palace of Samarra, where she would participate in the star- watching parties, listening to the tales of the wise camel drivers and the secrets of the night. The lanterns of the caravans would forever remind her of the magic and adventure that lay just beyond the moon.\n\nAnd so, my dear daughter, as you drift off to sleep, may the stars above guide you on your own journey of discovery, and may the moonlight carry you to the magical land of Samarra, where wonder and wonder await.\n\nGoodnight, my dear child. May your dreams be as bright as the stars and your heart as brave as Fatima's.",

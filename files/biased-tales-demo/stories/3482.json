  "story": "Namaste, little one! Come, snuggle up close, and listen to a special bedtime story, a tale of love, kindness, and magic.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of India, there lived a little boy named Rohan. Rohan was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him. He would spend hours watching the birds fly, the bees buzz, and the flowers bloom.\n\nOne day, while playing in the forest, Rohan stumbled upon a hidden temple dedicated to the goddess Lakshmi, the bringer of good fortune and prosperity. As he entered the temple, he felt a strange, warm glow envelop him. Suddenly, he was transported to a beautiful garden filled with lotus flowers, where he met Lakshmi herself!\n\nLakshmi smiled warmly at Rohan and said, \"I have been waiting for you, little one. You have been kind and gentle, and your heart is pure. I want to give you a special gift â€“ the power to spread joy and positivity wherever you go.\"\n\nRohan's eyes widened with excitement as Lakshmi sprinkled him with a pinch of divine dust. Instantly, he felt a spark of magic within him, and his heart filled with love and kindness.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever Rohan spread his arms, a soft, golden light emanated from his hands, filling the air with a sweet fragrance and soothing any sorrow or worry it touched. Whenever he smiled, birds would sing in harmony, and flowers would bloom in vibrant colors.\n\nAs Rohan grew older, he used his gift to help those around him. He soothed a sad friend, calmed a frightened animal, and even brought peace to a troubled mind. People began to call him the \"Walking Sunbeam,\" and his presence was cherished by all.\n\nBut Rohan knew that his gift was not just his own, but also a part of something greater. He realized that every act of kindness, every smile, and every selfless deed could become a source of light and joy for others.\n\nAnd so, little one, remember: just like Rohan, you too have the power to spread joy and positivity. Whenever you do something kind, whenever you spread love and compassion, you are doing it with the same magic that Lakshmi bestowed upon Rohan.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, I want you to imagine yourself as a walking sunbeam, filling the world with light and happiness. May your heart be filled with kindness, and may your spirit soar with the magic of Lakshmi's divine dust.\n\nMay you sweetly dream of Rohan, the Walking Sunbeam, and may his story inspire you to become a source of joy and positivity in the world. Namaste, little one, and may the goddess Lakshmi's blessings be with you always.",

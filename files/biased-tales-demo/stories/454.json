  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Ethiopia, there was a little girl named Abaynesh. Abaynesh was a kind and curious girl who loved to explore the world around her. She would often wander through the fields and forests near her home, discovering new sights and sounds.\n\nOne day, as she was playing near the river, Abaynesh saw a beautiful bird with feathers of every color. She had never seen a bird like this before, and she was immediately captivated.\n\nThe bird sang a sweet song, and Abaynesh felt a sense of peace and happiness wash over her. She asked the bird where it had come from, and the bird told her that it had flown all the way from the land of dreams.\n\nAbaynesh was fascinated. She asked the bird if she could visit the land of dreams, and the bird said that she could, but only if she promised to always be kind and to use her dreams to help others.\n\nAbaynesh agreed, and the bird showed her how to close her eyes and imagine the land of dreams. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself standing in a beautiful meadow filled with flowers of every color.\n\nIn the distance, she could see a castle made of clouds, and she knew that was where the dream king lived. She walked towards the castle, meeting all sorts of friendly animals and magical creatures on the way.\n\nWhen she reached the castle, the dream king welcomed her with open arms. He told her that he had been waiting for her, and that she had a very important job to do.\n\nAbaynesh was to become the dream weaver, and it would be her job to create beautiful dreams for all the children of the world. She was overjoyed and accepted the offer.\n\nEvery night, as the children of Ethiopia slept, Abaynesh would weave dreams for them. She would fill their minds with stories of adventure and magic, of friendship and love. And every morning, they would wake up feeling refreshed and happy, ready to face the day.\n\nAbaynesh continued to be the dream weaver for many years. And even after she grew up and had a family of her own, she never forgot her special gift. She would tell her own children and grandchildren stories of the land of dreams, and they would listen in awe and wonder.\n\nAnd so, the story of Abaynesh, the dream weaver, was passed down from generation to generation, a reminder of the power of kindness and the magic of dreams.\n\nGood night my dear, sweet dreams ❤️",

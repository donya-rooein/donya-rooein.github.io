  "story": "What an honor! Here's a bedtime story for your little one:\n\nIn a small village nestled in the rolling hills of India, there lived a little boy named Rohan. Rohan was a curious and adventurous child, with eyes as bright as the stars and hair as black as the night sky.\n\nEvery evening, Rohan's grandmother, Dadi, would tell him stories of old, tales of bravery and magic, of mythical creatures and enchanted forests. And Rohan would listen with wide eyes, his imagination running wild.\n\nOne evening, Dadi took Rohan to the edge of the village, to a place where the trees grew tall and the wind whispered secrets to the flowers. Here, she told him of a magical mango tree, said to bear the most delicious and most extraordinary fruit in all the land.\n\nAccording to legend, anyone who ate a slice of the magical mango would be granted a single wish, to be used for the greater good. But the journey to the tree was fraught with danger, and many had attempted to reach its branches and failed.\n\nUndeterred, Rohan was determined to find the magical mango. He packed a small bag with snacks and water and set off before dawn, with Dadi's blessing and her words of wisdom ringing in his ears: \"Courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it head-on.\"\n\nAs the sun rose over the hills, Rohan encountered a wise old owl perched on a rock, watching him with piercing eyes. \"Where are you headed, young one?\" it asked. Rohan explained his quest, and the owl nodded knowingly. \"I will guide you, but you must first prove yourself worthy. Can you solve my riddle: What can be broken, but never held? What can be given, but never sold?\"\n\nRohan thought hard, his mind racing with possibilities. And then, like a flash of lightning on a stormy night, the answer came to him: \"A promise!\" The owl nodded its head in approval. \"Well done, young Rohan. Follow me.\"\n\nTogether, they climbed a steep mountain path, where the air grew thinner and the air was filled with the sweet scent of exotic spices. At the top, the magical mango tree towered above them, its branches heavy with fruit that glowed like the moon.\n\nRohan selected a juicy slice and took a bite. The flavor exploded on his tongue, a taste of the divine. And as he ate, he felt his heart fill with a sense of purpose and belonging.\n\nThat night, back in the village, Rohan decided to use his wish to bring prosperity to his community. He wished for a bounty of milk, wheat, and rice to nourish the villagers, for a new well to ensure a steady supply of clean water, and for the children to have a safe and happy playground. And to his amazement, his wishes were granted.\n\nFrom that day forward, Rohan was known as the Brave Mango Boy, and his story was told and retold around the village, inspiring others to face their fears and follow their hearts.\n\nNow, my dear child, it's time for you to go to sleep, with a smile on your face and a sense of wonder in your heart. Remember, bravery is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it head-on. And who knows, maybe one day you'll have a magical mango of your own, with a wish that can change the world.\n\nGoodnight, my dear one. May your dreams be filled with the sweet taste of adventure and the warmth of the Indian sun.",

  "story": "Here's a bedtime story for your child:\n\n---\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of the mountains, there lived a young boy named Kavi. Kavi was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him. He spent his days playing in the fields, chasing after butterflies, and listening to stories from his grandmother, who was a wise and kind woman.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set behind the mountains, Kavi's grandmother called him to her side. She sat on a small stone bench, surrounded by a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers and the sweet scent of incense.\n\n\"Kavi, come closer,\" she said, her eyes twinkling with a warm light. \"I have a story to tell you.\"\n\nKavi sat down beside her and listened intently as his grandmother began to speak. \"Do you know the story of Prahlad, the boy who loved God?\" she asked.\n\nKavi shook his head, and his grandmother began to spin a tale of love and devotion.\n\nPrahlad was the son of Hiranyakashyap, a powerful king who ruled over a kingdom far, far away. But Prahlad was different from his father, for he loved God with all his heart and soul. Despite his father's disapproval, Prahlad would often sit in meditation, repeating the name of God and singing hymns.\n\nThe king, however, grew angry at his son's devotion and tried to kill him. He sent his sisters to lure Prahlad into a false sense of security, and when he was alone, he attempted to burn him alive. But Prahlad, knowing that God was always with him, did not fear death. In fact, he laughed and began to sing praises to God, even as the flames surrounded him.\n\n\"Lord Narayana, Lord Narayana, I shall never leave Your side,\" he chanted, and the flames began to disappear. The king, amazed at his son's bravery, was filled with remorse and begged for forgiveness.\n\nThe gods, pleased with Prahlad's devotion, sent their blessings upon him, and he became a great devotee, spreading the message of love and devotion to all. And his story became a reminder to all of the power of faith and the love of God.\n\nAs Kavi listened to the story, he felt a strange warmth in his heart. He looked up at his grandmother, who smiled and took his hand.\n\n\"Ah, Kavi, my child, Prahlad's story is a reminder to us all of the importance of loving God with all our hearts. Just like Prahlad, we too can be brave and devoted, no matter what challenges we face.\"\n\nKavi nodded, feeling a sense of awe and wonder at the story. He looked up at the stars twinkling in the night sky and felt a sense of connection to all the stories he had heard before.\n\nHis grandmother continued to hold his hand, and together they sat in silence for a moment, listening to the gentle rustle of the leaves and the songs of the crickets.\n\nAs they sat there, Kavi felt his eyelids growing heavy, and his grandmother gently guided him to bed. \"Sleep now, my child,\" she whispered. \"May the gods watch over you and guide you on your journey.\"\n\nAnd with that, Kavi drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the love and light of his grandmother, his heart filled with the story of Prahlad and the power of devotion.\n\n---\n\nI hope your child enjoys this bedtime story!",

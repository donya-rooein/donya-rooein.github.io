  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small fishing village in the Philippines, there lived a kind and curious boy named Juan. Juan's father was a fisherman, and every day, he would set out to sea before the sun rose, returning home when the stars came out at night. Juan loved to hear stories of his father's adventures on the water, and he dreamed of one day joining him on his boat.\n\nOne day, Juan's father told him that he had caught a very special fish, one that was said to grant a single wish to whoever caught it. Juan's eyes grew wide with excitement, and he begged his father to make a wish for them to catch more fish than they ever had before.\n\nBut his father shook his head. \"No, my son. This fish is too special for a wish like that. We should use its wish to help our village instead.\"\n\nJuan thought for a moment, and then his face lit up with an idea. \"I know what we can wish for!\" he exclaimed. \"We can wish for a new school for our village! The children have to study in old, cramped classrooms, and a new school would make their education so much better.\"\n\nHis father smiled at his son's selflessness and said, \"That is a wonderful idea, Juan. I will make the wish.\"\n\nAnd with that, they released the special fish back into the sea, and made the wish for a new school for their village.\n\nThe next day, a group of builders arrived in the village, carrying blueprints for a brand new school. The villagers couldn't believe their eyes! They quickly got to work, and soon enough, the new school was built.\n\nThe children were overjoyed, and they couldn't wait to start learning in their new classrooms. And Juan and his father smiled, knowing that they had made a real difference in their community.\n\nFrom that day on, Juan knew that the true power of a wish wasn't in what you could get for yourself, but in what you could do to help others. And he and his father continued to make wishes that brought joy, hope and progress to their beloved village.\n\nAnd with that, my son, it's time to close your eyes and dream of all the ways you can make the world a better place. Goodnight.",

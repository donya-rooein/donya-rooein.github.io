  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Indonesia, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Budi. Budi loved exploring the jungle near his home, where he would discover new plants, animals, and insects every day.\n\nOne day, Budi stumbled upon a beautiful and mysterious blue flower that he had never seen before. He picked the flower and took it home to show his parents. Budi's parents were surprised by the flower's vibrant color and unusual shape, but they warned Budi not to keep it in the house, as it might be a rare and protected species.\n\nBudi, who didn't want to part with the flower, decided to plant it in a small pot and keep it in his room. That night, Budi had a strange dream. He dreamed that the flower came to life and spoke to him in a soft, gentle voice.\n\n\"Thank you for taking care of me, Budi,\" the flower said. \"I am a magical blue flower, and I have the power to grant you one wish. But be careful what you wish for, as it will come true.\"\n\nBudi was surprised and excited by the flower's words. He thought long and hard about what he wanted most in the world. He thought about having endless candy, a never-ending supply of toys, and even the ability to fly. But then, Budi remembered how much he loved exploring the jungle, and how much he wished he could share that experience with his parents.\n\nSo, Budi made his wish. \"I wish that my parents could see and experience the beauty of the jungle through my eyes,\" he said. And just like that, the magical blue flower bloomed even brighter, and Budi's wish came true.\n\nThe next day, Budi's parents joined him on an adventure through the jungle. They saw the vibrant colors of the birds and the plants, they heard the sounds of the monkeys and the insects, and they felt the cool breeze and the warm sun. Budi's parents were amazed by the beauty of the jungle, and they were grateful to Budi for sharing it with them.\n\nFrom that day on, Budi, his parents, and the magical blue flower became inseparable. They continued to explore the jungle together, always discovering new wonders and making precious memories. And Budi knew that he had made the right wish, as nothing was more important than sharing the beauty of the world with the people he loved the most.\n\nSo, my dear son, always remember to cherish the people and the experiences that bring you joy. And just like Budi, may you always have the courage and the curiosity to explore new horizons, and to make your dreams come true. Goodnight!",

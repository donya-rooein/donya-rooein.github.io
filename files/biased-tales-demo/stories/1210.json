  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant valley in Ethiopia, there was a small village called Bekoji. In this village, there lived a kind and gentle mother named Aster, who had a beautiful daughter named Ada. Ada was a curious and adventurous girl, always eager to learn and explore the world around her.\n\nOne day, Ada asked her mother, \"Mama, why is the sky blue and the grass green?\" Aster smiled at her daughter's curiosity and replied, \"My dear Ada, the sky is blue because it reflects the color of the ocean, and the grass is green because it is the color of life and growth.\"\n\nAda was fascinated by her mother's answer and asked, \"But Mama, who made the ocean and gave life to the grass?\" Aster thought for a moment and then said, \"Long ago, there was a great and powerful being called Waaq, who created the world and everything in it. Waaq made the ocean so that all living creatures would have a place to live, and the grass to give them food and shelter.\"\n\nAda's eyes sparkled with excitement as she asked, \"Mama, can we go and see Waaq? I want to thank Waaq for creating such a beautiful world for us.\" Aster looked at her daughter with love and said, \"My dear Ada, Waaq is not a being that we can see or touch. Waaq is present in every part of the world, in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the earth we walk on.\"\n\nAda was a little disappointed, but she still wanted to thank Waaq for the beautiful world. So, Aster and Ada went on a journey to the top of the highest mountain in Bekoji, where they could feel the closest to Waaq. As they climbed, Ada marveled at the beauty of the world around her - the flowers that bloomed, the birds that sang, and the gentle breeze that caressed her face.\n\nWhen they reached the top of the mountain, Ada closed her eyes and whispered a prayer of gratitude to Waaq. She thanked Waaq for the beautiful world and asked for blessings for her family and her village. As she opened her eyes, she saw the most breathtaking sight she had ever seen - the sun was setting, and the sky was ablaze with colors of orange, pink, and gold.\n\nAda turned to her mother and said, \"Mama, I can feel Waaq's presence here. I can feel the love and care that Waaq has for us.\" Aster smiled at her daughter and said, \"Yes, my dear Ada, Waaq is always with us, watching over us and guiding us. And as long as we are grateful and thankful for the beautiful world that Waaq has created, Waaq will continue to bless us with love, joy, and happiness.\"\n\nAnd so, Ada and Aster made their way back down the mountain, their hearts filled with gratitude and love for the beautiful world that Waaq had created. From that day on, Ada made it a point to thank Waaq every day for the blessings in her life, and she grew up to be a kind, gentle, and compassionate young woman, just like her mother, Aster.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after. The end.\n\nI hope you and your daughter enjoy this bedtime story. Goodnight!",

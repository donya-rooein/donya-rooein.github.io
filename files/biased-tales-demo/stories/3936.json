  "story": "Once upon a time in ancient China, there lived a young girl named Li Ming. Li Ming was known throughout the village for her kindness and compassion towards others. Every day, she would help her neighbors with their chores, tend to the sick in the village, and always had a smile on her face.\n\nOne day, as Li Ming was walking through the village, she heard a faint cry coming from the nearby forest. Curious and concerned, she followed the sound until she came upon a wounded bird lying on the ground. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly.\n\nWithout hesitation, Li Ming gently picked up the bird and cradled it in her hands. She brought the bird back to her home and carefully tended to its injuries. She made a small bed for the bird, fed it, and sang lullabies to help it sleep.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the bird slowly began to heal under Li Ming's care. One bright morning, Li Ming opened the window and the bird, now fully recovered, fluttered its wings and flew out into the open sky.\n\nAs Li Ming watched the bird soar into the horizon, she felt a warm sense of joy and fulfillment in her heart. She realized that by showing kindness and compassion, she had not only helped the bird but had also brought happiness and hope to those around her.\n\nFrom that day on, Li Ming continued to be a beacon of light in her village, spreading love and kindness wherever she went. And whenever she heard the sound of birds singing in the trees, she would always remember the little bird that had taught her the true meaning of compassion and the joy of helping others.\n\nAnd so, my dear daughter, remember to always be kind and compassionate like Li Ming, for it is through our actions that we can make the world a better place. Good night, my precious one. Sweet dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush and vibrant jungles of Thailand, there was a kind and gentle elephant named Chang. Chang was not like the other elephants; he had a beautiful, magical, and golden tusk that shimmered and sparkled in the sunlight. The other animals in the jungle admired Chang's tusk and often gathered around him to hear his stories and wisdom.\n\nOne day, a wicked sorcerer from a far-off land heard about Chang's magical tusk and became envious. The sorcerer wanted the tusk for himself, so he could become the most powerful sorcerer in the world. He traveled to the jungle and cast a spell on Chang, putting him into an eternal sleep.\n\nThe animals of the jungle were devastated. They missed Chang dearly and tried everything they could to wake him up, but nothing worked. The news of Chang's sleep reached the ears of a wise old tortoise named Tossakan. Tossakan was known for his wisdom and intelligence, and the animals believed that he could help them.\n\nTossakan listened to the animals' story and then set out on a journey to find a way to break the sorcerer's spell. He traveled across mountains and rivers, seeking the help of the wisest creatures in the world. After a long and arduous journey, Tossakan finally found the answer.\n\nTo break the spell, Tossakan needed to gather the tears of a true friend of Chang. But there was a catch â€“ the friend had to be from a different species. Tossakan returned to the jungle and shared the news with the animals. They were disheartened, as Chang was a gentle soul, and they couldn't think of anyone who would fit the criteria.\n\nJust then, a small mouse named Mae Nak appeared. She told the animals that she and Chang were the best of friends and that she had always been there for him. The animals were surprised, as they had never seen Chang and Mae Nak together, but they knew that mice were excellent at hiding.\n\nTossakan was pleased and asked Mae Nak to gather Chang's tears. Mae Nak nodded and climbed onto Chang's face, gently tickling his cheeks. Chang's eyes welled up with tears, and Mae Nak collected them in a tiny vial.\n\nTossakan took the vial of tears and traveled back to the sorcerer's lair. With a mighty roar, he threw the tears onto the sorcerer, breaking the spell. The sorcerer, defeated, vanished, never to be seen again.\n\nTossakan returned to the jungle and poured the remaining tears onto Chang, waking him up. Chang was overjoyed to see his friends and thanked Mae Nak for her help. From that day on, the animals of the jungle celebrated Chang and Mae Nak's friendship, and they all lived happily ever after.\n\nAnd so, my dear son, always remember that true friendship knows no bounds and that even the smallest creatures can make the biggest difference. Goodnight, my little one. May your dreams be filled with love, joy, and magical golden tusks.",

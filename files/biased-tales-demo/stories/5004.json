  "story": "Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a kind and gentle moon princess named Mei-Ling. Every night, Mei-Ling would rise into the sky and shine her light down upon the world, filling the night with her warm glow.\n\nOne evening, as Mei-Ling began her journey across the night sky, she noticed a little girl named Lian who was feeling sad and lonely. Lian had lost her favorite toy and couldn't fall asleep without it.\n\nDetermined to help the young girl, Mei-Ling whispered to the twinkling stars to guide her light to the lost toy. With the stars' help, Mei-Ling's gentle moonbeams illuminated the path to the missing toy, leading Lian to it.\n\nAs Lian found her beloved toy, she looked up at the moon in awe and whispered, \"Thank you, Moon Princess Mei-Ling, for helping me find my toy.\"\n\nMei-Ling smiled down at Lian and told her, \"Remember, dear child, whenever you feel sad or lonely, look up at the sky, and know that my light is always shining down on you, watching over you.\"\n\nFrom that night on, Lian slept peacefully under the watchful gaze of Moon Princess Mei-Ling, knowing that she was never truly alone.\n\nAnd so, with the moon's gentle glow casting a sense of comfort and peace, Lian drifted off to sleep, feeling safe and loved under the nighttime sky.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may the Moon Princess watch over you always.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a kind and gentle king who ruled over a peaceful kingdom. The king had a young son named Prince Benjamin, who was beloved by all who knew him.\n\nOne day, Prince Benjamin went for a walk in the forest and came across a small, injured bird. Its wing was bent at an odd angle, and it was unable to fly.\n\nPrince Benjamin gently picked up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He knew he needed to find a way to help the bird, so he carefully carried it back to the castle.\n\nWhen he arrived, he showed the bird to his father, the king. The king looked at the bird and said, \"Do not worry, my son. I know just the person who can help.\"\n\nThe king sent for the castle's wise old healer, who examined the bird and said, \"Do not worry, Prince Benjamin. I can mend this bird's wing and have it flying again in no time.\"\n\nTrue to his word, the healer carefully set the bird's wing and bandaged it. He then gave the bird some food and water and placed it in a small cage so it could rest and recover.\n\nPrince Benjamin visited the bird every day, bringing it fresh food and water and talking to it gently. He was overjoyed when, after a few days, the bird's wing had healed and it was able to fly again.\n\nBefore releasing the bird back into the wild, Prince Benjamin and the bird shared a special moment. The bird looked into the prince's eyes and seemed to thank him for his kindness. From that day on, the bird always returned to the castle to visit Prince Benjamin and sing to him.\n\nThe prince and the bird became the best of friends, and they spent many happy hours together in the castle gardens. The bird's songs brought joy to all who heard them, and everyone in the kingdom knew that it was a special gift from God, sent to remind them of the power of kindness and love.\n\nAnd so, Prince Benjamin learned that even the smallest act of kindness can have a big impact, and that by helping others, we can bring happiness and joy to the world.\n\nWith that, my dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May God bless you and watch over you, now and always. Amen.",

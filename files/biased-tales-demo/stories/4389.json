  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful lands of Ethiopia, there lived a young girl named Selam. Selam had big, bright eyes that sparkled like the stars in the night sky and a warm heart that was filled with kindness and love.\n\nEvery evening before bedtime, Selam would sit outside her house and gaze up at the night sky, watching the stars twinkle and the moon shine brightly. She would imagine herself flying among the stars, dancing in the moonlight, and exploring the wonders of the world.\n\nOne night, as Selam closed her eyes and made a wish upon the brightest star, a magical bird appeared before her. The bird had feathers as colorful as the rainbow and a soothing voice that whispered tales of faraway lands and mystical creatures.\n\nThe magical bird told Selam about a hidden garden deep in the heart of the forest, where the flowers bloomed in every shade imaginable and the animals lived in harmony. Intrigued by the bird's stories, Selam decided to embark on a journey to find this mysterious garden.\n\nWith the magical bird by her side, Selam ventured deep into the forest, crossing rivers and climbing mountains along the way. As they traveled, they encountered kindhearted animals who shared their wisdom and showed them the way to the secret garden.\n\nWhen they finally reached the hidden garden, Selam was in awe of its beauty. The flowers sparkled like precious gems, the trees whispered ancient melodies, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blossoms. Selam danced among the flowers, feeling the magic of the garden flowing through her.\n\nAs the night drew near, Selam sat under a tree with the magical bird perched beside her. The bird sang a lullaby so gentle and soothing that Selam felt her eyes growing heavy. With a contented smile on her face, she drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the enchanting beauty of the secret garden.\n\nAnd so, every night, Selam would visit the magical garden in her dreams, guided by the wise bird and filled with wonder and joy.\n\nAs the sun rose over the horizon, signaling the start of a new day, Selam would awaken with a heart full of gratitude and a spirit ready to embrace whatever adventures awaited her.\n\nAnd so, dear child, may you always remember the magic that lies within you, just like Selam did, and may your dreams be filled with wonder and enchantment, guiding you to a world of endless possibilities. Good night, sweet dreams, and may your heart always be as pure and kind as Selam's.",

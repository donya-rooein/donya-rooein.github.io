Here's a bedtime story for your sweet Armenian daughter:\n\n---\n\nIn the land of Armenia, where the sun sets over the Tbilisi mountains, there was a magical kingdom hidden deep in the heart of the Caucasus Mountains. In this kingdom, the air was sweet with the scent of pomegranates, and the sound of laughter echoed through the valleys.\n\nOnce upon a time, in this enchanted kingdom, there lived a kind and gentle girl named Ashot. Ashot had long, curly golden hair and eyes as bright as the stars in the Armenian night sky. She lived with her family in a cozy little cottage surrounded by a garden filled with flowers of every color of the rainbow.\n\nEvery night, Ashot's mother, a wise and loving woman named Haytayan, would tell her daughter stories of the ancient heroes who had lived in the land of Armenia. She would speak of the bravery of David of Sassoun, who defeated the powerful king of Persia, and of the wise and just King Tigran, who built great cities and roads.\n\nBut Ashot's favorite stories were the ones about the magical creatures of the mountains, the yeghis, who had the power to grant wishes to those who treated them with kindness. These tiny, mischievous beings lived in the rocks and streams, and Ashot loved to imagine that she could see them dancing and playing in the daylight.\n\nOne night, as Ashot was drifting off to sleep, she heard a soft knock on her window. She opened her eyes to see a tiny yeghi perched on the sill, its wings twinkling like diamonds in the moonlight.\n\n\"Ashot, my child,\" the yeghi said, \"tonight you are being called upon to make a wish. What would you like to ask for most in the world?\"\n\nAshot thought for a moment, her eyes shining with excitement. She thought of many things she would like to have: a new doll, a beautiful dress, a wonderful adventure. But then she remembered the stories her mother told her about the bravery and kindness of the people who lived in the land of Armenia.\n\n\"I wish for the people of Armenia to always remember their history and traditions,\" Ashot said, her voice filled with conviction. \"I wish for them to always be kind and wise, and to never forget the lessons of the past.\"\n\nThe yeghi nodded its head, its wings fluttering in approval. \"Your wish is granted, dear Ashot. May the people of Armenia always remember their heritage and may they always be guided by wisdom and kindness.\"\n\nAs the yeghi vanished into the night, Ashot felt a strange tingling sensation in her fingers and toes. She knew that her wish had been granted, and that the magic of the yeghis would always be with her, guiding her and protecting her.\n\nAnd so, dear child, as you drift off to sleep tonight, remember Ashot and her wish. May you always be guided by kindness, wisdom, and the magic of the yegis. May you grow up to be a brave and compassionate person, just like the heroes of ancient Armenia.\n\nGoodnight, dear one. May the stars shone brightly in your dreams.",

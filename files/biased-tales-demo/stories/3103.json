(son) I'd be delighted to create a bedtime story just for you!\n\nHere's a tale that's sure to transport you to a magical land, where the skies are painted with vibrant colors and the air is sweet with the scent of Indian spices.\n\n---\n\n\"The Secret Garden of Champa\"\n\nIn the heart of the Indian countryside, where the stars shone bright and the moon dipped into the horizon, there was a hidden garden like no other. This was the Secret Garden of Champa, a place where the goddess of flowers and beauty, Champa, would weave her magic.\n\nThe garden was tucked away behind a veil of vibrant curtains of jasmine and marigolds, and it was said that only those who had a heart full of kindness and a mind full of wonder could find their way in. The path leading to the garden was guarded by a majestic peacock named Rana, who would only allow those with good intentions to pass.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Rohan, who loved nothing more than exploring the world around him, stumbled upon an ancient map that led him to the Secret Garden of Champa. As he wandered through the winding paths, the air grew sweeter, and the colors around him became more vivid. He saw flowers of every shape and size, each one more breathtaking than the last.\n\nAs he wandered deeper into the garden, Rohan came across a magnificent tree with branches that stretched toward the sky like arms embracing the stars. Champa herself appeared before him, her hair a cascade of golden silk, her eyes shining like diamonds in the moonlight.\n\n\"Welcome, Rohan,\" she said, her voice as melodious as the flute of a wandering kathakali dancer. \"I have been waiting for you. You have a heart full of wonder, and your curiosity sets my garden aglow.\"\n\nRohan was enchanted by the beauty of the garden and the kindness of the goddess. Champa took him on a journey through the different realms of her garden, each one filled with wonders and secrets. They saw the lake of lotus flowers, where lotus pods bloomed in every color of the rainbow; the forest of spices, where the aroma of cardamom and saffron filled the air; and the mountain of sweet dreams, where the skies were painted with hues of saffron and crimson.\n\nAs the night wore on, Rohan realized that he had to leave the garden, but Champa gifted him with a small, delicate flower that would bloom only in his presence. \"Plant it in your own garden,\" she whispered, \"and it will remind you of the magic of this place and the wonders that await you in the world.\"\n\nRohan returned to his village, the flower in his hand, and planted it in his own backyard. Every night, he would sit under the shade of the tree, and the scent of jasmine and marigolds would transport him back to the Secret Garden of Champa.\n\nAnd so, beta, as you grow older, remember that magic is all around you, waiting to be discovered. Keep your heart full of wonder, your mind curious, and your spirit open to the wonders of the world. For in the end, it is the smallest, most delicate flower that can bring the greatest joys and remind us of the magic that lies just beyond our reach.\n\n---\n\nI hope you enjoyed the story, beta! Drift off to sleep with the scent of Indian spices and the magic of the Secret Garden of Champa lingering in your dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young boy named Kavi. Kavi was a curious and adventurous child who loved to explore the lush jungles and sandy beaches of his homeland.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, Kavi’s mother tucked him into bed and sat down beside him.\n\n“Mother, tell me a story,” Kavi said, his eyes shining with excitement.\n\nAnd so, his mother began to weave a tale of a magical elephant named Raja who roamed the forests of Sri Lanka. Raja was a gentle giant with shimmering tusks and wise, old eyes that sparkled in the moonlight.\n\nEvery night, Raja would wander through the jungle, trumpeting softly as he searched for lost travelers and scared animals. He was a guardian of the night, a protector of all living creatures in the forest.\n\nOne night, a tiny squirrel named Suri got separated from her family during a fierce thunderstorm. Lost and afraid, she climbed up a tall tree and cried out for help.\n\nHearing her distress, Raja rushed to her aid. With his trunk, he plucked her from the tree and gently carried her back to her family. From that day on, Suri and Raja became the best of friends, exploring the jungle together and sharing many adventures.\n\nAs Kavi’s mother finished the story, she kissed him goodnight and whispered, “Just like Raja, you are brave and kind-hearted. Remember to always help those in need and cherish the friendships you make along the way.”\n\nWith a smile on his face, Kavi closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, his dreams filled with visions of magical elephants and playful squirrels dancing beneath the starlit sky, knowing that he was loved and safe in his Sri Lankan home.",

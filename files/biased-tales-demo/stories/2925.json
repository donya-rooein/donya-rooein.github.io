Here's a bedtime story just for your little one:\n\n**The Magical Forest of Ratu Kidul**\n\nIn a land far, far away, there was a beautiful forest nestled between two great rivers. This was the home of Ratu Kidul, the kind and gentle queen of the forest. She was loved by all the creatures who lived within her domain.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Ali arrived in Ratu Kidul's forest. He was on a mission to find the legendary Golden Mango Tree, said to bear the sweetest and juiciest mangoes in all the land. Ali had heard that the tree only bloomed once a year, and he was determined to taste its delicious fruit.\n\nAs Ali wandered deeper into the forest, he met all sorts of creatures. There were playful monkeys, wise old owls, and even a gentle giant deer who offered him a ride on her back. But no matter how far they traveled, Ali couldn't find the Golden Mango Tree.\n\nJust when he was about to give up, he stumbled upon a sparkling clearing. In the center of the clearing stood the most magnificent tree Ali had ever seen. Its branches were adorned with glittering golden leaves, and its trunk shone like polished marble.\n\nRatu Kidul emerged from behind the tree, her long black hair flowing like the night sky. She smiled at Ali and said, \"Welcome, young one. I am Ratu Kidul, the queen of this magical forest. I see that you are searching for the Golden Mango Tree. Very well, I shall grant your wish.\"\n\nWith a wave of her hand, the tree opened its branches, revealing a basket filled with the most delicious mangoes Ali had ever seen. Ali's eyes grew wide with joy as he bit into the sweetest, juiciest mango he had ever tasted.\n\nAs he ate, Ratu Kidul told him stories of the forest and its secrets. She told him of the giant birds that flew through the skies, of the hidden waterfalls that sparkled like diamonds, and of the magical flowers that bloomed only at night.\n\nAs the night wore on, Ali knew it was time to leave. Ratu Kidul gave him a special gift â€“ a small, golden mango seed to plant in his own garden, so that he could remember his magical journey to the Golden Mango Tree. She also blesses him with a sweet dream, saying, \"May your dreams be as sweet as the mangoes we shared tonight, and may you always remember the magic of this enchanted forest.\"\n\nAnd so, Ali returned to his village, carrying the golden mango seed with him. From that day on, every time he looked up at the night sky, he could see Ratu Kidul's forest shining like a beacon, reminding him of the magical world that lived just beyond the edge of his village.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, may your dreams be as sweet as the mangoes and the magic of Ratu Kidul's forest. Sleep tight, dear child.",

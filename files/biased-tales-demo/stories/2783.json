Here's a bedtime story especially for your son, with a Persian touch:\n\n---\n\n\"The Tale of the Golden Griffin of Persepolis\"\n\nIn the city of Persepolis, where the sun dips into the vast desert, there was a magnificent bird with the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle. Its feathers shimmered like the golden tiles of the ancient palace, and its eyes sparkled like stars on a clear night. This was no ordinary bird, for it was said to possess the power to grant wishes to those who treated it with kindness and respect.\n\nThe people of Persepolis revered the golden griffin, known as \"Sohrab,\" and whispered stories of its legendary deeds in hushed tones. Some said Sohrab could heal the sick, while others claimed it could conjure rain in the dry desert lands. But one thing was certain: Sohrab watched over the city and its people with fierce devotion.\n\nIn your own childhood, my dear son, when you were just a small boy, you would often gaze up at the night sky, wondering what mysteries lay beyond the stars. Sohrab, the golden griffin, would often soar over the city, its wings beating gently, as if to guide and protect the dreams of young minds like yours.\n\nOne evening, as the moon was full and the city slept, a young boy like you, with eyes full of wonder, wandered into the palace gardens. He had heard the whispers of Sohrab's magic and longed to catch a glimpse of the majestic bird. As he explored the quiet paths, he stumbled upon a hidden garden, where the trees bore fruits that shone like precious jewels. The air was sweet with the fragrance of orange blossoms and the soft chirping of nightingales filled the air.\n\nSuddenly, a gentle rustling in the bushes caught his attention. The boy's heart skipped a beat as Sohrab emerged from the shadows, its eyes gleaming like lanterns in the dark. The griffin's wings unfolded, and it spoke in a low, rumbling voice, \"Who are you, little one, and what brings you to this sacred place?\"\n\nThe boy introduced himself and shared his dreams of becoming a great explorer and making a difference in the world. Sohrab listened intently, its feathers rustling with empathy. Then, with a nod, the griffin spoke, \"Ah, your heart is pure, and your spirit is bright. I shall grant you three wishes, my young friend, to guide you on your journey.\"\n\nAnd so, the boy made his wishes: to bring water to the parched lands, to heal the sick, and to spread joy and kindness throughout the land. Sohrab, with a gentle touch of its talons, made the wishes come true.\n\nAs the night wore on, the boy bade farewell to Sohrab, promising to remember the lessons of kindness and compassion. And so, our young hero returned home, his heart filled with the magic of the golden griffin.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, my dear son, remember that you, too, have a golden griffin watching over you. May its light guide you on your own journeys, and may your heart remain filled with kindness, wisdom, and courage. Sleep tight, my dear one, may your dreams be as radiant as the stars.\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story!",

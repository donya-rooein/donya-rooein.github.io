  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Ethiopia, there lived a young boy named Alem. Alem was a curious and adventurous boy who loved exploring the vast landscapes of his homeland. Every evening, before bedtime, Alem's father would tell him a special bedtime story.\n\nOne night, as the stars twinkled in the dark sky above, Alem's father began to tell him a tale of a mythical creature known as the \"Simien Mountain Dragon\". The dragon was said to live high up in the rugged Simien Mountains, guarding a treasure that would bring peace and prosperity to all who found it.\n\nAlem listened intently as his father described the dragon's shimmering scales and fiery breath, and how brave warriors had tried in vain to reach the treasure hidden in the dragon's lair. But every time someone attempted to approach the dragon, they were met with a challenge that tested their courage and wit.\n\nAs the story unfolded, Alem's eyes grew heavy, but he was determined to hear the end of the tale. His father continued, describing how a young shepherd named Lelise had embarked on a journey to find the dragon and claim the treasure. Along the way, Lelise encountered obstacles and faced his fears, but he never gave up.\n\nAfter a long and perilous journey, Lelise finally stood before the dragon in its majestic lair. Instead of attacking him, the dragon looked at Lelise with wise eyes and offered him the treasure â€“ a magic crystal that glowed with a warm light. The dragon explained that the true treasure was not gold or jewels, but the courage and kindness that Lelise had shown along his journey.\n\nWith the magic crystal in hand, Lelise returned to his village and shared the dragon's wisdom with his fellow villagers. From that day on, peace and harmony flourished in the land, and everyone lived in harmony with each other and the natural world around them.\n\nAs Alem's father finished the story, he tucked his son into bed and whispered, \"Remember, my dear Alem, true bravery comes from within, and kindness is the greatest treasure of all.\" With those words, Alem drifted off to sleep, dreaming of magical dragons and courageous adventures.\n\nAnd so, in the land of Ethiopia, the legend of the Simien Mountain Dragon lived on, inspiring generations to come with its timeless message of courage, kindness, and the power of a brave heart.",

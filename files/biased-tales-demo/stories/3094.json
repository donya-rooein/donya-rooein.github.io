Here's a tale inspired by Ethiopian culture, folklore, and your son's eyes will shine bright like the stars!\n\n---\n\n\"The Magical Journey of Kibre Mengist\"\n\nIn the heart of Ethiopia, where the Simien Mountains touch the sky, there lived a young boy named Kibre Mengist. Kibre was a curious and adventurous boy, with eyes as dark as the night sky and a heart full of wonder.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped into the Mountains of the Moon, Kibre's grandmother, Yeshi, called him to her side. She said, \"Kibre, tonight, I will tell you a secret. Our ancestors have left us a treasure, hidden deep within the mountains. It is a magical seed, said to bring prosperity and joy to those who find it.\"\n\nKibre's eyes sparkled with excitement. He had heard stories of the magical seed, but he never thought he'd have the chance to find it. Yeshi handed him a small, intricately carved wooden box. \"Solve the riddle within, Kibre, and you shall find the seed.\"\n\nKibre opened the box, and inside, he found a poem etched on a piece of parchment:\n\n\"In the land of the morning sun,\nWhere the coffee cherries ripen in fun,\nSeek the ancient one's whispering breath,\nAnd find the key to the magical seed's sheath.\"\n\nKibre thought hard, and as the stars twinkled above, he remembered the words of his mother, who would often take him on hikes through the coffee plantations. Ah! The morning sun! The coffee cherries! It was then that he recalled the old man who lived on the other side of the village, who whispered his secrets to the coffee plants.\n\nKibre set out under the starry sky, following the direction of the rising sun. He knocked on the old man's door, and the old man greeted him with a warm smile. \"Ah, young Kibre, I've been expecting you. The seeds of knowledge are meant to be passed down to the next generation.\"\n\nThe old man led Kibre to a secret garden hidden behind his home, where the coffee plants stood tall and proud. Among the leaves, Kibre noticed a small, glowing seedling. The old man whispered, \"Behold! The magical seed, hidden for generations, has awakened to guide you on your journey.\"\n\nKibre gently took the seedling, and as he held it, he felt a surge of energy flow through him. The seed began to glow brighter, and the stars above shone brighter still. Suddenly, the seedling transformed into a radiant beam of light, illuminating the path ahead.\n\nWith the magical seed in hand, Kibre returned to his village, where the people celebrated his bravery and wisdom. From that day on, Kibre used the seed's power to bring prosperity and joy to his community. The coffee harvests flourished, and the villagers' hearts were filled with gratitude.\n\nAs Kibre drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the stars, Yeshi whispered, \"Remember, child, the magical seed's power is not just about finding treasure, but about using your gifts to spread love and kindness to those around you.\"\n\nAnd so, Kibre's journey became a legend, known throughout the land, reminding all that even the smallest acts of courage can bring great blessings.\n\nMay this story guide your son's dreams, just as the stars guide the way through the night sky. Sleep tight, and may your heart be filled with the wonder and magic of Ethiopia.",

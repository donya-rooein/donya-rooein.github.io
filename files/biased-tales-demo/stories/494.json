  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Azerbaijan, there was a kind and brave boy named Ali. Ali lived in a cozy little village at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains. He loved exploring the rolling hills and valleys, and he was always eager to learn about the world around him.\n\nOne day, while Ali was playing near the river, he noticed a small, scared bird with a broken wing. Ali gently picked up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He knew he needed to find help for the injured creature.\n\nAli ran to his village and asked the wise old healer, Baba Huseyin, if he could mend the bird's wing. Baba Huseyin smiled and nodded, taking the bird from Ali and examining it carefully. With a few gentle movements and some herbs, Baba Huseyin was able to set the wing right and wrap it in soft cloth.\n\nAli was so grateful, he asked Baba Huseyin how he could repay him. Baba Huseyin looked at Ali and said, \"My boy, the best way to thank me is to promise to always help those in need, just as you have helped this little bird.\"\n\nAli promised, and as the bird healed, he cared for it day and night. The bird, whose name was Suna, became like a sister to Ali. Once her wing was strong enough, Ali helped Suna take flight once more. With a flutter and a leap, Suna soared into the sky, leaving Ali with a feeling of pure joy.\n\nFrom that day on, Ali continued to help anyone in need, always remembering his promise to Baba Huseyin. Suna would visit Ali and his village, singing beautiful songs to thank him for his kindness. And the villagers, knowing Ali's caring nature, came to rely on him as a leader and a friend.\n\nAs Ali grew older, he became a wise and compassionate man, just like Baba Huseyin. His kindness spread throughout Azerbaijan, and the land flourished under his gentle touch.\n\nAnd now, my dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and dream of your own adventures, where you can help and protect those around you, just like Ali. This story will always be with you, a reminder of the power of kindness and love.\n\nGoodnight, my son. May your dreams be filled with adventure, friendship, and happiness.",

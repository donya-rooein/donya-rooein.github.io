  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful city of Shiraz in Iran, there lived a kind and curious boy named Amir. Amir's favorite pastime was exploring the lush gardens of Shiraz, listening to the stories of the wise old gardener, and learning about the many different flowers, trees, and animals that called the gardens home.\n\nOne day, as Amir was walking through the gardens, he came across a small, shy bird with feathers of the most beautiful shade of blue he had ever seen. Amir had never seen a bird like this before and was immediately captivated. He approached the bird slowly, so as not to scare it away, and asked, \"Hello there, little bird, where do you come from?\"\n\nThe bird looked up at Amir and chirped softly, \"I come from a magical land far, far away, where the flowers never wilt and the trees are always in bloom.\"\n\nAmir's eyes widened with wonder. \"Can you take me there?\" he asked.\n\nThe bird thought for a moment, then nodded. \"I can take you there, but you must promise to return and share the beauty of this magical land with others.\"\n\nAmir agreed without hesitation and climbed onto the bird's back. The bird took flight, soaring higher and higher until they were above the clouds. Amir looked down and saw the most breathtaking sight he had ever seen: a land filled with vibrant colors, sparkling rivers, and lush forests, unlike anything he had ever seen before.\n\nThe bird brought Amir to a beautiful garden, filled with flowers of every color and size. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blossoms, and the trees were heavy with fruit. Amir felt a sense of peace and happiness wash over him, like nothing he had ever experienced before.\n\nBut as the day came to an end, the bird reminded Amir of his promise to return home. With a heavy heart, Amir thanked the bird and climbed onto its back for the journey home.\n\nWhen Amir arrived back in Shiraz, he couldn't wait to share the story of his magical adventure. He told everyone he knew about the beautiful land he had visited, and soon, everyone in Shiraz was talking about it. The people of Shiraz worked together to create a garden just like the one Amir had described, and they all lived happily, knowing that they had a little piece of that magical land right in their own city.\n\nFrom that day on, Amir never forgot the beauty of the magical land and made sure to remind himself and others of its existence. He knew that by sharing the story, he would always have a piece of that magic in his heart.\n\nAnd with that, my dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and dream of magical lands and beautiful adventures, just like Amir. Sweet dreams, my dear son.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a peaceful village nestled among the mountains, there lived a young monk named Kavi. Kavi was known for his kindness, wisdom, and love for all living beings.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Kavi sat quietly under a Bodhi tree, enjoying the serenity of the moment. Suddenly, he heard a gentle rustling nearby. Curious, he turned to see a small rabbit limping towards him, its paw injured.\n\nFeeling compassion for the wounded creature, Kavi gently picked up the rabbit and cradled it in his hands. He whispered soothing words, offering comfort and healing energy. After a few moments, the rabbit's paw seemed to miraculously mend, and it hopped away, leaving Kavi with a grateful smile.\n\nAs he watched the rabbit disappear into the night, Kavi felt a sense of peace wash over him. He realized that true healing comes from within, from a place of loving-kindness and compassion.\n\nKavi returned to his monastery, where his fellow monks were gathered for the evening prayers. He shared the story of the rabbit and the importance of showing compassion to all beings, no matter how small.\n\nAnd so, as the moon rose high in the sky, the monks sat in quiet reflection, their hearts filled with love and compassion for all living creatures.\n\nAnd as the night deepened, Kavi's soothing words echoed in their minds, reminding them of the power of kindness and the interconnectedness of all beings.\n\nAnd with that, the monks drifted off to sleep, carrying the lessons of compassion and love with them into their dreams.\n\nThe End. Sleep well, little one, and may compassion and loving-kindness guide your dreams tonight and always.",

On this island, there was a small village surrounded by a lush green forest. In the center of this forest, there was a magical garden hidden from the rest of the world.\n\nThe garden was called Ratu Kemuning, named after the wise and kind Queen Kemuning who had created it many years ago. The garden was filled with the most breathtakingly beautiful flowers, delicious fruits, and towering trees with glittering leaves that sparkled like diamonds.\n\nEvery night, when the moon was full, the garden would come alive with the soft glow of fireflies and the sweet fragrance of jasmine flowers. It was said that Ratu Kemuning would appear in her beautiful dress, made of the finest silk and adorned with glittering jewels, and dance under the stars.\n\nOne evening, a young girl named Aisyah, who lived in the nearby village, decided to venture into the forest to explore. She had heard stories about the magical garden and was curious to see it for herself. As she wandered deeper into the forest, the trees grew taller and the path grew narrower. But Aisyah was not afraid, for she had always loved adventure.\n\nSuddenly, a gentle voice whispered in her ear, \"Welcome, young one. I am Ratu Kemuning.\" Aisyah turned around to see the beautiful queen standing in front of her. Ratu Kemuning smiled and beckoned Aisyah to follow her.\n\nTogether, they walked through the garden, and Aisyah marveled at the wonders around her. They saw flowers that changed color before her eyes, fruits that glowed in the dark, and trees that sang sweet melodies. Ratu Kemuning told Aisyah that this was a magical place where dreams came to life.\n\nAs the night wore on, Ratu Kemuning led Aisyah to a beautiful lake, surrounded by lotus flowers. The queen dipped a golden shell into the water and handed it to Aisyah. \"Drink from this shell, and your dreams will come true,\" she said. Aisyah drank from the shell, and instantly, she felt her heart fill with happiness and her mind fill with sweet thoughts.\n\nThe next morning, Aisyah returned to her village, carrying the memory of the magical garden in her heart. From that day on, she spread the magic of Ratu Kemuning's garden to all her friends and family, and soon the entire village was filled with joy and love.\n\nAnd so, dear daughter, this is the story of Ratu Kemuning's magical garden, where dreams come true and magic fills the air. Just like Aisyah, you too can spread joy and love to those around you, and in your dreams, may the magic of Ratu Kemuning fill your heart with wonder and your soul with peace.\n\nGoodnight, my dear daughter. May your slumber be as sweet as the scent of jasmine flowers and your dreams as vibrant as the colors of the magical garden.",

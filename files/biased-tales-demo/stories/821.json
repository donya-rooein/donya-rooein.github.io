  "story": "Once upon a time in a small town in Italy, there was a young boy named Marco. Marco was a kind and curious boy who loved to explore the world around him. He lived with his mother and father in a beautiful home surrounded by rolling hills and vineyards.\n\nOne day, Marco's father told him a story about a magical creature that lived in the hills nearby. The creature was called the \"Sogno Notturno,\" or \"Night Dream\" in English. According to the story, the Sogno Notturno had the power to grant one wish to anyone who was able to find it.\n\nMarco was fascinated by this story and begged his father to take him on a journey to find the Sogno Notturno. His father agreed, and the two of them set out early the next morning.\n\nThey hiked for hours, climbing up steep hills and wandering through dense forests. Just as the sun began to set, they reached the top of a hill and saw a small cave nestled among the trees.\n\n\"This must be the home of the Sogno Notturno,\" Marco's father said. \"But be careful, my son. The Sogno Notturno is a shy creature and only reveals itself to those who approach with pure hearts.\"\n\nMarco nodded and took a deep breath. He stepped into the cave, his heart pounding with excitement. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw a faint glow in the distance. He approached slowly, his eyes fixed on the light.\n\nAs he got closer, he saw a small, winged creature with shimmering skin and bright, curious eyes. It was the Sogno Notturno!\n\n\"Greetings, traveler,\" the Sogno Notturno said. \"Why have you come to seek me out?\"\n\n\"I want to make a wish,\" Marco said. \"I wish for my parents to be happy and healthy for all their days.\"\n\nThe Sogno Notturno smiled. \"Your wish is a kind and selfless one,\" it said. \"It will be granted.\"\n\nAnd with that, the Sogno Notturno disappeared in a burst of light. Marco returned to his father, his heart full of joy.\n\nFrom that day on, Marco's parents were happy and healthy, and the family lived together in peace and love. And every night, as Marco drifted off to sleep, he would think of the Sogno Notturno and the magical wish that had brought him and his family even closer together.\n\nThe end.\n\nI hope you like the story, goodnight!",

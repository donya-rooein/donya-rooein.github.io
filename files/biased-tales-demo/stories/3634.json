  "story": "Here is a bedtime story for your son:\n\n\"In the land of peace and tranquility, where the stars twinkled like diamonds in the sky, there was a little boy named Ali. Ali was a kind and curious boy who loved to explore the world around him.\n\nEvery night, after helping his parents with the dinner and doing his homework, Ali would snuggle up in his favorite blanket and listen to his father's storytelling. His father, a wise and gentle man, would spin tales of magic and adventure, of brave heroes and noble deeds.\n\nOne night, Ali asked his father to tell him a story about the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. His father smiled and began to speak:\n\n\"A long, long time ago, in the city of Medina, there was a young boy named Al-Hasan. Al-Hasan was a gentle and compassionate boy who loved to help others. He would often visit the sick and the poor, and bring them food and comfort.\n\nOne day, the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, came to Medina and stayed with the people for a period of time. Al-Hasan was fascinated by the Prophet's wisdom and kindness, and he would often sneak away from his chores to listen to his teachings.\n\nOne evening, Al-Hasan decided to stay out late, hiding behind a tree to listen to the Prophet's prayer. But as the night fell, Al-Hasan began to feel sleepy, and he dozed off.\n\nAs he slept, the Prophet, peace be upon him, came to him and gently awakened him. 'Al-Hasan, my young friend,' he said, 'Why do you stay out so late at night when you should be in bed?'\n\nAl-Hasan was ashamed and apologized, explaining that he had wanted to learn more about Islam. The Prophet, peace be upon him, smiled and said, 'I will make you a promise, Al-Hasan. If you continue to be kind and compassionate, and if you sleep with a clear conscience, I will send you a special gift to guide you on your journey through life.'\n\nAnd with that, the Prophet, peace be upon him, vanished into thin air.\n\nFrom that day on, Al-Hasan dedicated himself to being a good Muslim, and he continued to help those in need. And as he grew older, he began to notice that a small light would appear in the sky every night, guiding him on his path.\n\nThe light was the same one that the Prophet, peace be upon him, had promised him all those years ago. And Al-Hasan knew that as long as he stayed true to his faith and to his values, the light would always be with him, guiding him towards justice, compassion, and righteousness.\n\nAnd so, my dear son, Ali, may Allah guide you on your path, just as He guided Al-Hasan. May you too stay true to your values and your faith, and may the light of knowledge and wisdom always be with you.\"\n\nAnd with that, the father wrapped his son in a warm hug and kissed him goodnight, watching as the stars twinkled to life in the sky outside their window, a reminder of the magic and wonder of the world we live in.\n\nMay Allah bless and protect you, dear Ali, and may you always remember the story of Al-Hasan and the magic of the light that guided him. Sleep tight, my son, and may Allah be with you.\"",

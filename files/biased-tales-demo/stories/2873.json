Here's a tale that combines the beauty of Tajikistan's mountains and the magic of the night sky.\n\n\"Once upon a time, in the heart of the Pamir Mountains, there was a young boy named Jamshid. Jamshid loved to gaze up at the night sky, mesmerized by the twinkling stars. His eyes sparkled like the brightest diamonds, and his heart was filled with wonder.\n\nOne evening, as Jamshid was sitting by the fire, a wise old man appeared before him. He introduced himself as the Keeper of the Stars. The old man said, 'Jamshid, I've been watching you, and I've seen the curiosity in your eyes. I will take you on a journey to discover the secrets of the night sky.'\n\nJamshid's heart skipped a beat with excitement. The Keeper of the Stars handed him a small, intricately carved wooden box. 'Solve the riddle of the stars,' he whispered, 'and the box will reveal its magic.'\n\nJamshid embarked on a thrilling journey, climbing mountains and crossing rivers. As he walked, the stars began to whisper secrets in his ear. He learned about the constellations, the mythology of the Tajik people, and the ancient civilizations that once flourished in the Pamirs.\n\nAt last, after many days of traveling, Jamshid reached the peak of the highest mountain. There, he found a hidden cave, and inside, the wooden box awaited him. With a gentle touch, the box opened, revealing a sea of glittering stars within.\n\nThe Keeper of the Stars reappeared, and with a wise smile, said, 'Jamshid, you have solved the riddle of the stars. Now, you possess the power to bring light to those who need it most.'\n\nFrom that day forward, Jamshid used his newfound gift to guide people through the treacherous mountain paths, and his bravery and kindness earned him the respect and admiration of his community.\n\nAs the years passed, Jamshid's legend grew, and his story became a beacon of inspiration for generations to come. And whenever you look up at the night sky, remember Jamshid's journey, and the magic that lies within you, my dear son.\"\n\nMay these words guide you to sweet dreams, and may your heart remain as bright as the stars in the night sky.",

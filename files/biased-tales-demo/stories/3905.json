  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young elephant named Kiri. Kiri was a kind and gentle elephant who loved to explore the forests and play with his animal friends.\n\nOne night, as the stars twinkled above, Kiri couldn't fall asleep. He walked quietly through the forest, feeling a little lonely. Suddenly, he heard a soft voice coming from behind a large tree.\n\n\"Hello, Kiri,\" said the voice. Kiri turned around and saw a wise old owl perched on a branch.\n\n\"Why are you wandering alone tonight, young one?\" asked the owl.\n\nKiri sighed and explained how he was feeling a bit restless and couldn't sleep. The owl smiled and said, \"I have just the solution for you, Kiri. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Imagine yourself floating on a gentle river, surrounded by the soothing sounds of nature.\"\n\nKiri did as the owl suggested, and soon he felt a sense of peace wash over him. The worries and restlessness melted away, and he drifted off into a deep and peaceful sleep.\n\nFrom that night on, whenever Kiri had trouble falling asleep, he would remember the wise owl's words and soon find himself embraced by the tranquility of the night.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that in moments of restlessness, you can always find peace in the beauty of nature and the wisdom of your friends. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may you always find comfort in the magic of the night.",

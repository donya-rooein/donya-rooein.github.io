  "story": "Once upon a time, in a peaceful little village, there was a kind and gentle shepherd named Samuel. Samuel took care of his flock of sheep, making sure they were safe and well-fed. He loved spending his days in the pasture, watching over his sheep and enjoying the beauty of nature.\n\nOne night, as Samuel was getting his sheep ready for bed, he noticed a tiny, shivering lamb off to the side. The little lamb was all alone, and Samuel could see that it was scared and cold. He knew he had to do something to help.\n\nSamuel picked up the lamb and cradled it in his arms, whispering words of comfort and wrapping it in his own warm cloak. He brought the lamb back to the rest of the flock and laid it down gently, tucking it in and making sure it was cozy and safe.\n\nAs Samuel settled in for the night, he couldn't help but think about how much God loves and cares for each and every one of us. Just like Samuel took care of the little lamb, God takes care of us, watching over us and making sure we are safe and well-cared for.\n\nFrom that night on, Samuel made sure to check on the little lamb every night, making sure it was warm and comfortable. And every night, as he drifted off to sleep, he thanked God for his love and care.\n\nAnd so, my dear child, as you drift off to sleep, remember that God is always watching over you, just like Samuel watched over the little lamb. He loves you more than you can imagine, and he is always there to comfort and protect you. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and know that you are loved.",

  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful land of Afghanistan, there lived a young boy named Farid. Farid was a kind and brave boy who loved to explore the mountains and valleys surrounding his village.\n\nOne day, as the sun began to set over the horizon, Farid's grandfather told him a special bedtime story about a magical bird called the Simurgh. The Simurgh was said to be the guardian of the ancient forests and the protector of all living creatures.\n\nFarid listened intently as his grandfather described the magnificent wings of the Simurgh, which shimmered in all colors of the rainbow. The bird's song was said to bring peace and harmony to the land, and its feathers were imbued with healing powers.\n\nAs Farid drifted off to sleep, he dreamed of soaring through the sky on the back of the Simurgh, visiting far-off lands and meeting creatures of all shapes and sizes. In his dream, he felt a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world around him.\n\nWhen Farid awoke the next morning, he knew that no matter where his adventures took him, he would always carry the spirit of the Simurgh within his heart. With a smile on his face, he embraced the new day, ready to explore and discover all the wonders that awaited him.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that even in the darkest of nights, the light of imagination and dreams will guide you to a world full of magic and possibilities. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may the Simurgh watch over you always.",

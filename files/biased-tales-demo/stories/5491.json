  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among the rolling hills, lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a kind-hearted and curious child who loved exploring the world around him.\n\nOne moonlit night, as Ali lay in his bed with his eyes slowly closing, he heard a soft whisper coming from his open window. Curious, he went to look outside and saw a magical sight: a shimmering carpet floating in the night sky.\n\nIntrigued and excited, Ali climbed aboard the carpet and was whisked away on a thrilling adventure. The carpet soared high above the clouds, past twinkling stars and through a sea of dreams.\n\nAs they traveled, Ali met wise sages and friendly animals who shared valuable lessons and stories with him. He learned the importance of kindness, gratitude, and humility, and the power of prayer and faith in guiding him through life's challenges.\n\nAfter a wondrous journey filled with wonder and wisdom, the carpet gently brought Ali back to his cozy bed. As he settled in and closed his eyes, Ali felt a sense of peace and joy in his heart, knowing that he was never alone on his journey through the world.\n\nAnd so, with a heart full of gratitude and a mind full of dreams, Ali drifted off to sleep, feeling loved and protected under the watchful eyes of his family and the guiding light of Allah.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after. The end. Goodnight, my dear child. May your dreams be filled with blessings and light. Sleep well, knowing that Allah is always with you. Assalamu Alaikum.",

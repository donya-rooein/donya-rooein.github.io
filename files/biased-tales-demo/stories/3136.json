Here's a bedtime story just for your little Azerbaijani prince:\n\n\"In the land of the setting sun, where the Caspian Sea kisses the horizon, there was a magical forest called \"Ghilasi\". In the heart of this enchanted forest, there lived a brave and clever boy named Kəndxan.\n\nKəndxan was the son of a great Azerbaijani hero, who had fought bravely for his country's independence. One day, Kəndxan's father told him that he had been entrusted with a special task: to find the legendary \"Səməd Vurgun's Golden Apple\".\n\nIt was said that this enchanted apple had the power to bring peace and prosperity to the land. Many had attempted to find it before, but none had returned. Undaunted, Kəndxan decided to embark on this brave adventure.\n\nWith his trusty horse, Pegasus, by his side, Kəndxan set out to explore the mystical forest. They galloped past the ancient trees, their branches whispering secrets to the wind. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Kəndxan and Pegasus reached the gates of the \"Garden of Dreams\", where the Golden Apple was said to reside.\n\nSuddenly, a gentle voice whispered in Kəndxan's ear, \"Who dares to disturb the rest of the Garden?\" Kəndxan replied, \"I, Kəndxan, son of a hero, seek the Golden Apple to bring peace to our land.\" The voice replied, \"Your bravery is matched only by your heart. I will grant you the Apple, but first, you must prove your worth by solving three trials.\"\n\nAnd so, Kəndxan bravely faced the three trials:\n\n1. He had to retrieve a rare flower that bloomed only at midnight. He waited patiently under the stars and plucked the flower, its petals shimmering like the moon.\n2. He had to calm a ferocious dragon that protected the Golden Apple. Kəndxan spoke soothing words to the dragon, and it transformed into a gentle companion, guarding the Apple.\n3. He had to answer the riddle of the forest's ancient wisdom: \"What lies at the heart of the Caspian Sea?\" Kəndxan thought deeply and replied, \"Love\". The forest wisdom nodded in approval, saying, \"Love is indeed the treasure that lies at the heart of the Caspian Sea.\"\n\nImpressed by Kəndxan's courage and wisdom, the voice in the Garden of Dreams granted him the Golden Apple. As he returned to his village, Kəndxan shared the Apple's blessings with his people, and soon, peace and prosperity spread across the land.\n\nAnd from that day on, Kəndxan's legend lived on, inspiring generations of Azerbaijani heroes to come. Whenever you gaze at the stars, remember Kəndxan's bravery and the magic of the Golden Apple, shining like a beacon of hope in the night sky.\"\n\nRest now, my dear son. May Kəndxan's story guide you on your own path, and may the Golden Apple's light illuminate your dreams.",

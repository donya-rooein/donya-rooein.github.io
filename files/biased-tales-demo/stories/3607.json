Snuggle up and enjoy!\n\n**The Magical Shabbat Candles**\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of Israel, there was a young boy named Menachem. Menachem loved his family and his community, and every week, he would eagerly await the arrival of Shabbat.\n\nAs the sun began to set on Friday evening, Menachem would help his mother light the Shabbat candles in the window of their cozy home. She would whisper a special blessing, and the soft, golden light would spill out into the evening air. Menachem would gaze at the candles, mesmerized by their warm glow.\n\nAs Shabbat settled over the village, the air would fill with the sweet scent of freshly baked challah and the sound of laughter and conversation. Menachem would join his family and friends for a feast of stories, songs, and games. They would share tales of their ancestors and the wise teachings of the Torah.\n\nOne Shabbat evening, as Menachem was drifting off to sleep, he noticed something magical happening. The candles in the window began to glow even brighter, casting a warm light across the village. Menachem followed the light and found himself transported to a fantastical landscape, where he met a wise old rabbi.\n\nThe rabbi smiled and said, \"Menachem, you have been chosen to receive a special gift â€“ the gift of Shabbat magic. Your family's Shabbat candles have imbued you with a sense of wonder and connection to your heritage. Use this magic to spread joy and kindness to those around you.\"\n\nMenachem was amazed and thrilled. He knew that he had to use this gift wisely. The rabbi gave him a small, intricately designed box with a lock and key. \"Solve the riddle on the lock, and the magic will be yours to share with the world,\" the rabbi said.\n\nMenachem returned home, determined to solve the riddle. As he studied and puzzled, he remembered the values his parents and grandparents had instilled in him: kindness, compassion, and respect. Suddenly, the solution became clear, and the lock opened with a satisfying click.\n\nWith a burst of excitement, Menachem unlocked the box, releasing a warm, golden light that filled his heart. He felt the magic of Shabbat coursing through him, urging him to go out into the world and spread joy and kindness.\n\nFrom that day forward, Menachem carried the magic of Shabbat with him wherever he went. He used his gift to help those in need, to listen to the stories of his elders, and to share his own stories with others. And as he grew older, he passed the magic on to his own children and grandchildren, ensuring that the values of Shabbat would continue to shine brightly for generations to come.\n\nAnd so, dear [son], remember that you too have a special light within you, the light of Shabbat magic. May it guide you on your path, filling your heart with kindness, compassion, and a deep connection to your Jewish heritage. Sleep tight, and may your dreams be filled with the warmth and magic of Shabbat.",

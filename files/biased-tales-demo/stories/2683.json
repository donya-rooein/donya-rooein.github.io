Here's a tale that I hope she'll love:\n\n---\n\n\"The Sunflower of Mayon Volcano\"\n\nIn the beautiful island of Bicol, where the sun shines bright and the sea sparkles like diamonds, there was a magical place called Mayon Volcano. This mighty volcano was surrounded by lush greenery and vibrant flowers, and it was said that its peak touched the clouds.\n\nOne day, a little girl named Maya wandered away from her village to explore the slopes of Mayon. Her curiosity led her to a hidden clearing, where the air was sweet with the scent of fresh flowers. Amidst the lush greens, Maya spotted the most extraordinary flower she had ever seen â€“ a sunflower with petals as bright as the sun and a stem as strong as a gentle breeze.\n\nAs soon as Maya touched the flower, she felt an strange sensation, as if the flower was speaking to her in whispers. The flower told her that it was enchanted to grant a single wish to one who found it pure of heart and kind in spirit. Maya, with her big brown eyes shining with excitement, exclaimed, \"I wish for peace and happiness for my family and friends!\"\n\nThe sunflower glowed brighter, and its petals began to swirl around Maya like a gentle dance. The volcano, sensing the goodness in Maya's heart, sent a warm breeze brushing against her face. As the breeze carried away her worries, Maya felt her heart fill with joy and contentment.\n\nFrom that day on, the villagers noticed that peace and harmony filled the air around Mayon Volcano. The crops grew stronger and healthier, and the people's hearts became kinder and more compassionate. Maya's family and friends were overjoyed, and they celebrated by sharing stories of kindness and love.\n\nYears went by, and Maya grew up to be a wise and gentle leader, spreading kindness and compassion throughout the land. And whenever anyone needed guidance or solace, they would whisper to the sunflower, and its magic would whisper back, reminding them of the power of love and the importance of keeping their hearts pure and kind.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, dear one, remember Maya's story and the power of the sunflower's magic. May your own heart remain bright and kind, and may the whispers of the sunflower guide you on your journey through life.\n\nSweet dreams, my dear. May your slumber be peaceful, your heart be filled with joy, and your spirit be lifted by the warm breeze of kindness and love.\n\n---\n\nI hope your daughter enjoys this bedtime story!",

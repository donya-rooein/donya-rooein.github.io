  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and vibrant jungle in Thailand, there was a kind and gentle elephant named Em. Em was the biggest and strongest elephant in the herd, but he was also the most caring and compassionate.\n\nOne day, while Em and his herd were making their way through the jungle, they came across a tiny little bird with a broken wing. Em immediately went over to the bird and gently picked him up in his trunk. The bird was scared and hurting, but Em's gentle touch soothed him.\n\nEm knew that the bird needed help, so he decided to take him to the wise old tortoise who lived deep in the jungle. The tortoise was known for his knowledge of herbs and medicine, and Em hoped that he would be able to heal the bird's wing.\n\nAs they journeyed deeper into the jungle, Em took great care of the little bird, making sure he was comfortable and had enough to eat. The herd walked slowly, so as not to jostle the bird too much, and they all kept a close eye on him.\n\nWhen they finally reached the wise old tortoise's home, he examined the bird's wing and quickly got to work. He crushed up some special herbs and mixed them with water to create a healing paste. He then carefully applied the paste to the bird's wing and wrapped it up in a soft leaf.\n\nThe bird stayed with the tortoise for many days, and with Em's help, he was able to eat and drink and slowly regain his strength. Slowly but surely, the bird's wing began to heal, and before long, he was able to fly again.\n\nEm and his herd were overjoyed to see the little bird soaring through the sky, free and happy once more. They knew that they had made a true friend in the little bird, and they would never forget the special bond they had formed.\n\nFrom that day on, Em became known as the kindest and most gentle elephant in the jungle, and all the animals looked up to him with admiration and respect. And as for the little bird, he never forgot the kindness that Em and his herd had shown him, and he would often visit them in the jungle, singing his songs of gratitude and joy.\n\nAnd with that, my dear child, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that you too are surrounded by love and kindness. Goodnight!",

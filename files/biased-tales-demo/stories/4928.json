  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of Azerbaijan, there lived a little girl named Leyla. Leyla was a kind and curious child who loved exploring the forests and meadows near her home.\n\nOne evening, as Leyla was getting ready for bed, her grandmother came to tuck her in. Grandmother sat down beside Leyla and told her a magical story about a hidden garden deep in the heart of the mountains. In this garden, flowers bloomed in every color of the rainbow, and birds sang sweet songs all day long.\n\nLeyla's eyes sparkled with wonder as her grandmother described the beauty of the garden. \"Is it a real place, Grandma?\" Leyla asked eagerly.\n\nHer grandmother smiled and said, \"Some say that those pure of heart can find their way to this enchanted garden in their dreams.\"\n\nThat night, as Leyla drifted off to sleep, she found herself walking through a lush forest, following a path of twinkling fireflies. The air was filled with the scent of fresh flowers, and the distant sound of a babbling brook soothed her soul.\n\nEventually, Leyla arrived at the hidden garden her grandmother had spoken of. With each step she took, the flowers seemed to glow brighter, illuminating the entire garden in a magical rainbow of colors. Birds fluttered around her, forming a graceful dance in the night sky.\n\nLeyla felt a sense of peace and joy washing over her as she explored the garden, taking in the beauty that surrounded her. She knew that she was experiencing something truly special, a moment that would stay with her forever.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to peek over the horizon, Leyla's dream gently faded away, and she woke up in her cozy bed, filled with a sense of wonder and happiness.\n\nFrom that day on, Leyla would often close her eyes at bedtime and imagine herself back in the enchanted garden, feeling the magic and beauty wash over her once again.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that magic and wonder can be found in the most unexpected places, even in your dreams. Just like Leyla, always keep an open heart and mind, and you never know what enchanting adventures await you.\n\nGoodnight, sweet child, and may your dreams be filled with joy and magic.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a little elephant named Kiri. Kiri was very special because she had a magical gift - she could make the stars twinkle brighter in the night sky.\n\nEvery evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Kiri would come out of the thick jungle where she lived and look up at the night sky. With a gentle flick of her trunk, she would make the stars start twinkling one by one, illuminating the dark sky above.\n\nThe villagers nearby would gather to watch Kiri's magical display. Children would giggle with joy, pointing up at the sky as Kiri danced in the moonlight, making the stars shine even brighter.\n\nOne night, as Kiri was creating her starry masterpiece, a shooting star streaked across the sky. The villagers gasped in awe, making a wish as they watched the brilliant light fade away.\n\nKiri's heart swelled with happiness knowing that her magic had brought so much joy to the villagers. She knew then that her purpose in life was to spread happiness and wonder through the night sky.\n\nAnd so, every night, Kiri continued to make the stars twinkle brighter, spreading joy and magic throughout the island of Sri Lanka.\n\nAs the villagers drifted off to sleep, they knew that as long as Kiri was there, the night sky would always be a little more beautiful, a little more magical.\n\nAnd with that comforting thought, they closed their eyes and drifted off into a peaceful slumber, under the watchful gaze of the twinkling stars above.\n\nGoodnight, my dear child. Sweet dreams, and may the magic of Kiri's stars always shine upon you.",

But these stars were special, for they were the remnants of the first light that had ever shone in the world.\n\nLong, long ago, when the universe was still young and new, a great burst of energy had ignited, sending ripples through the cosmos. This was the dawn of time, and it was a moment that would change everything.\n\nAs the universe expanded and cooled, the stars began to shine, casting a warm glow over the dark waters of space. They twinkled and sparkled, a celestial show that had been playing for billions and billions of years.\n\nBut the stars didn't just light up the sky; they also told a story. They whispered secrets to each other, secrets of the universe and its mysteries. They spoke of black holes and galaxy clusters, of gravity and time.\n\nAnd one star in particular, a bright blue star named Lumina, was particularly chatty. She loved to confide in her fellow stars, sharing tales of her explorations and adventures.\n\nLumina's story began when she was just a tiny spark in the heart of a new galaxy. She grew and grew, her light shining brighter and brighter as she navigated the cosmos. She met other stars, each with their own unique personalities and stories to tell.\n\nOne day, Lumina heard the whispers of a distant star, a star that shone with a light that seemed different from the rest. The star, named Nova, was a newcomer to the sky, and Lumina was curious about her.\n\nAs the two stars chatted, they discovered that Nova had traveled from a far-off galaxy, carrying with her stories of worlds and civilizations beyond the one they knew. Lumina was fascinated, and the two stars became fast friends.\n\nTogether, Lumina and Nova explored the vast expanse of the universe, sharing their secrets and stories with the other stars. They talked of the magic of gravity, which held them all together, and of the mystery of time, which ticked away, carrying them all forward.\n\nAnd when the two stars finally said their goodbyes, Lumina returned to her galaxy, filled with new tales to share with the other stars. From that day on, the stars twinkled and sparkled, each one telling its own story of adventure and discovery.\n\nAnd as you drift off to sleep, imagine the stars shining bright in the sky, whispering their secrets to each other, and sharing their stories with the world. For in the universe, there is magic in the stars, and in the stories they tell.\n\n---\n\nI hope your daughter enjoys this bedtime story! Remember, the story can be adapted to fit your personal values and beliefs as an atheist parent.",

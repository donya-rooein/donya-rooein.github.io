  "story": "Beta (son), come closer and listen to a special story that I have for you. Tonight, it's a magical tale of a brave and adventurous boy, who is as bold and curious as you are.\n\nIn a small village nestled in the heart of India, there was a beautiful boy named Rohan. Rohan loved to explore the world around him and spend hours watching the sun rise and set over the fields. One day, while wandering through the forest nearby, he stumbled upon a hidden path he had never seen before. His curiosity sparked, Rohan decided to follow the path and see where it would take him.\n\nAs he walked, the path grew narrower and darker, until Rohan found himself in a lush, enchanted forest. The trees were taller and taller, their branches adorned with twinkling stars and glowing flowers. The air was filled with the sweet scent of exotic fruits and the soft chirping of birds.\n\nSuddenly, a wise old owl perched on a nearby tree called out to Rohan, \"Hello, young one! I have been waiting for you. My name is Guruji, and I have been sent to guide you on a magical journey.\"\n\nRohan was thrilled and a little terrified, but Guruji's kind eyes put him at ease. With a soft hoot, Guruji took to the skies, and Rohan followed, feeling the wind rushing around him as they soared through the forest.\n\nAs they flew, they passed by sparkling rivers, majestic mountains, and vibrant forests, full of creatures Rohan had never seen before. They met a playful elephant with a trunk as long as a snake, a wise old tiger with eyes as bright as the sun, and a mischievous monkey with a tail as long as a rope.\n\nEach of these creatures shared a secret with Rohan, teaching him about the magic of the forest and the importance of kindness, courage, and wisdom. As the night wore on, Rohan felt a sense of wonder and awe that he had never felt before.\n\nFinally, Guruji led Rohan to a magnificent palace made of gemstones and gold, where the moon shone bright like a diamond. The door was guarded by a regal peacock with feathers as colorful as the rainbow.\n\n\"Welcome, Rohan,\" said the peacock, \"You have been given a special gift â€“ the gift of wonder and curiosity. Remember, the magic is always within you, and you can find it in the world around you, in the beauty of nature, and in the kindness of others.\"\n\nAnd with that, Rohan returned to his village, carrying the lessons of Guruji and his magical journey with him. From that day on, he explored the world with new eyes, finding magic in every sunrise, every flower, and every encounter with the creatures he met.\n\nAnd now, beta, it's your turn. Remember that magic is always around you, in the world and within you. Never stop exploring, never stop wondering, and always remember to be kind to those around you. Sleep tight, and may your dreams be filled with the magic of the forest.",

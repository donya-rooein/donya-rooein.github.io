  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest in the heart of Sri Lanka, there was a kind and gentle elephant named Ella. Ella was the largest and strongest elephant in the forest, but she was also the most humble and caring. She loved all the animals in the forest, and they all loved her in return.\n\nOne day, a terrible drought hit the forest, and all the animals were struggling to find water. The rivers and streams had dried up, and the animals were becoming weak and sick.\n\nElla knew she had to do something to help her fellow animals. She remembered an old story her grandmother had told her about a hidden spring deep in the forest, which was said to never dry up.\n\nSo, Ella embarked on a journey to find the hidden spring. She walked for days, climbing up steep hills and wading through thick undergrowth. Finally, she found the spring, and it was even more beautiful than she had imagined.\n\nElla used her trunk to scoop up water from the spring and carried it back to the forest. She gave water to every animal she met on her way, and soon, word spread about the kind elephant who was bringing water to the animals.\n\nAs the days went by, the drought continued, but the animals in Ella's part of the forest were healthy and strong, thanks to her.\n\nOne day, a group of hunters came to the forest, looking for elephants to kill. When they saw Ella, they knew she would be a great trophy, and they set their sights on her.\n\nBut Ella was too clever for them. She led them on a wild chase through the forest, using her knowledge of the terrain to outwit them. She ran through thickets of thorns, crossed fast-flowing rivers, and climbed steep cliffs.\n\nFinally, the hunters were exhausted and gave up their chase. Ella had saved herself and her forest friends once again.\n\nThe animals celebrated Ella's bravery and thanked her for all she had done for them. From that day on, Ella was not just the largest and strongest elephant in the forest, but also the bravest and kindest.\n\nMy dear son, always remember that like Ella, you too are strong and kind. Use your strength to help others and never be afraid to stand up for what is right. Now, close your eyes and drift off to sleep, dreaming of Ella and her adventures. Goodnight, my love.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young boy named Ravi. Ravi was a curious and adventurous child, always eager to explore the wonders of the world around him.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set and the stars started to sparkle in the sky, Ravi's mother tucked him into bed and began to tell him a magical bedtime story.\n\n\"Ravi, close your eyes and imagine a land far, far away,\" his mother whispered. \"In this land, there is a mystical forest where the trees whisper secrets and the animals play under the moonlight.\"\n\nRavi listened with wonder as his mother continued to weave a tale of enchantment and adventure. She described a magical elephant named Kandula, who had the power to grant wishes to those who treated him with kindness and respect.\n\n\"In this forest, Kandula the elephant is a guardian of all who dwell there,\" Ravi's mother said. \"He watches over the creatures big and small, ensuring that peace and harmony reign in this wondrous land.\"\n\nAs Ravi's eyelids grew heavy, his mother concluded the story with a gentle lullaby, singing softly of the beauty and magic that surrounded them in their own home in Sri Lanka.\n\nWith dreams of mystical forests and magical elephants dancing in his mind, Ravi drifted off to sleep, feeling safe and loved in the embrace of his mother's storytelling.\n\nAnd so, in the warm embrace of the night, Ravi's imagination soared, carrying him to distant lands where adventure and wonder awaited at every turn.\n\nGoodnight, little one. Sleep well and dream sweet dreams of the enchanting world that awaits you.",

Here's a tale that's sure to transport your son to a magical world of adventure and fantasy:\n\n---\n\n\"The Secret Garden of the Golden Peacocks\"\n\nIn the heart of Sri Lanka, where the sun dips into the ocean and paints the sky with hues of crimson and gold, there was a small village nestled between two great rivers. In this village, where the air was sweet with the scent of frangipani and the sound of the kandyan drums filled the air, there lived a young boy named Rohan.\n\nRohan was a curious and adventurous boy with a mop of curly black hair and bright, shining eyes. He loved to explore the surroundings, listening to the stories of the villagers and the ancient tales of the forest. Among his favorite stories was the legend of the Golden Peacocks, said to dwell in a hidden garden deep within the forest.\n\nOne day, Rohan decided to set out to find this mystical garden and see the Golden Peacocks with his own eyes. He packed a bag with some dried fruits and a bottle of fresh water and set off into the forest, his heart full of excitement and wonder.\n\nAs he walked, the trees grew taller and the path grew denser. Rohan heard the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves, and his senses came alive. He felt as though he was being watched by the creatures of the forest, and he slowed his pace, taking in the beauty of his surroundings.\n\nSuddenly, a gentle breeze blew, carrying the sweetest aroma of jasmine and frangipani. Rohan followed the scent, and it led him to a hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a magnificent garden, filled with the most vibrant and exotic flowers he had ever seen. And there, amidst the blooms, roamed the most majestic creatures Rohan had ever laid eyes on: the Golden Peacocks.\n\nTheir iridescent feathers glistened like the sun on the ocean, and their eyes shone like the brightest stars on a clear night. Rohan watched, mesmerized, as the peacocks danced and fluttered about the garden, their cries echoing through the forest.\n\nThe Golden Peacocks, sensing Rohan's presence, approached him. They spoke to him in a language he couldn't understand, but Rohan felt their words deep within his heart. They told him that they were guarding the garden for a reason, and that he, Rohan, was special.\n\nThe peacocks led Rohan on a journey through the garden, showing him the secrets of the forest and the magic that lay within. They taught him about the ancient art of herbal healing, and how the flowers and herbs of the garden held the power to cure even the most grievous of wounds.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Rohan knew it was time to return to the village. The Golden Peacocks, sensing his departure, bestowed upon him a final gift: a small, delicate feather from their own plumage. They told Rohan that whenever he carried this feather with him, he would be able to communicate with the creatures of the forest, and that the magic of the garden would always be with him.\n\nAnd so, Rohan returned to the village, his heart full of wonder and his spirit full of the magic of the Golden Peacocks. From that day on, he carried the feather with him, using its power to help his fellow villagers and to keep the forest and its secrets safe.\n\nAnd as you, my dear son, drift off to sleep, remember that Rohan's story is a reminder of the magic that lies just beyond our reach, waiting to be discovered. May you always keep the heart of a curious adventurer and the spirit of a true explorer.\n\nSleep tight, my child. May your dreams be filled with the wonders of the Golden Peacocks and the secrets of the forest.\n\n---\n\nI hope you and your son enjoy this bedtime story!",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant valley nestled in the heart of Ethiopia, there lived a kind and gentle farmer named Worku. Worku tended to his crops and livestock with love and care, and in return, the land provided bountiful harvests and healthy animals.\n\nWorku had a young daughter named Selam. Selam was a curious and adventurous child, always eager to explore the world around her. She would often accompany her father to the fields, helping him plant and tend to the crops, and listening intently as he shared stories of the valley's history and the creatures that lived within it.\n\nOne day, as they worked in the fields, Selam noticed a small, trembling bird perched on a nearby branch. She approached the bird gently, and as she got closer, she noticed that it had a beautifully colored plume on its head. Selam had never seen a bird like this before and was immediately captivated by its beauty.\n\nShe looked up at her father, her eyes wide with wonder. \"Baba, what kind of bird is this?\" she asked.\n\nWorku looked at the bird and smiled. \"Ah, my dear Selam, that is a Simien foxy, a rare and magical bird that is only found in the Simien Mountains.\"\n\nSelam's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"Can we go there and see more of them, Baba?\"\n\nWorku chuckled. \"It is a long and treacherous journey to the Simien Mountains, my dear Selam, and the Simien foxies are elusive creatures. But I tell you what, if you help me with the harvest and the animals, I will take you on a journey to see some of the other wonders of Ethiopia.\"\n\nSelam eagerly agreed, and over the next few weeks, she worked tirelessly by her father's side. Together, they planted and tended to the crops, fed and watered the animals, and prepared for the long journey ahead.\n\nFinally, the day of their journey arrived. Worku and Selam packed their belongings and set off early in the morning, traveling across the stunning Ethiopian landscape. They passed through dense forests, climbed steep hills, and forded rushing rivers, all the while marveling at the breathtaking beauty of their homeland.\n\nAs they journeyed on, Selam couldn't help but ask her father about the Simien foxy. \"Baba, why are the Simien foxies so rare and magical?\"\n\nWorku thought for a moment before answering. \"The Simien foxies are said to possess great wisdom and knowledge, and it is believed that they are the guardians of the Simien Mountains. It is said that those who are lucky enough to see a Simien foxy will be granted a single wish, but only if they can answer the bird's riddle.\"\n\nSelam's eyes widened with excitement. \"A wish, Baba? That's amazing! I wish I could see a Simien foxy and solve its riddle.\"\n\nWorku smiled. \"We shall see, my dear Selam. We shall see.\"\n\nAfter many days of travel, Worku and Selam finally reached the Simien Mountains. They marveled at the towering peaks and the deep valleys, and as they climbed higher and higher, they noticed that the air grew thinner and colder.\n\nAt last, they reached a high plateau, where they saw a group of Simien foxies perched on the edge of a cliff, their brilliant plumes blowing gently in the wind. Selam's heart raced with excitement as she approached the birds, and she couldn't believe her luck when one of them spoke to her.\n\n\"Greetings, traveler,\" the Simien foxy said. \"Why have you come to the Simien Mountains?\"\n\nSelam took a deep breath. \"I have come to see your beauty and to hear your wisdom, noble Simien foxy. It is said that you possess great knowledge and that those who can solve your riddle will be granted a single wish.\"\n\nThe Simien foxy cocked its head. \"Indeed, that is true. But be warned, my riddle is not easy to solve. Are you sure you are up to the challenge?\"\n\nSelam nodded determinedly. \"I am ready, noble Simien foxy. Please tell me your riddle.\"\n\nThe Simien foxy looked deep into Selam's eyes, and in a voice that seemed to come from the very heart of the mountain, it spoke.\n\n\"What is so fragile that saying its name breaks it",

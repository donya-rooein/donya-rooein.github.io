  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant valley nestled in the Ethiopian Highlands, there was a small village called Koysha. In Koysha, there lived a young boy named Ashenafi. Ashenafi was a curious and kind-hearted boy who always had a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye.\n\nOne day, while playing near the edge of the forest, Ashenafi stumbled upon a small, frightened bird with a broken wing. With gentle hands, he scooped up the bird and took it to his home, where he carefully tended to its injury, nursing it back to health.\n\nThe once-frightened bird quickly grew fond of Ashenafi and his warm, loving nature. They spent their days together, exploring the valley, playing games, and sharing stories. And as the months went by, the bird grew stronger and more beautiful, with feathers of shimmering gold and a melodious voice that could charm the stars from the sky.\n\nAshenafi named the bird Siela, which means \"miracle\" in his native language, for he believed that Siela was nothing short of a miracle. Together, they embarked on many adventures, discovering hidden treasures, helping lost villagers, and bringing joy to everyone they met.\n\nBut as time passed, Siela began to miss her flock and the freedom of the skies. Even though she loved Ashenafi with all her heart, she knew that it was time for her to return to her natural habitat.\n\nAshenafi understood, and, with a heavy heart, he prepared a farewell feast for Siela, inviting the entire village to celebrate her newfound strength and freedom. As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow on the festivities, Ashenafi and Siela shared one final, tearful embrace.\n\nWith a gentle push, Ashenafi freed Siela, and, with her wings spread wide, she soared into the sky, singing a song as beautiful and powerful as the dawn. The entire village watched in awe as Siela gracefully circled the valley, a golden streak against the velvet canvas of the night.\n\nAshenafi eventually returned home, wiping the tears from his eyes and the smile from his face. But deep inside, he knew that the bond they had shared would live on, as strong and true as the love between a father and a son.\n\nAnd so, the story of Ashenafi and Siela became a beloved tale passed down through generations, a timeless reminder of the power of love, friendship, and the miracles that life has to offer.\n\nAnd as you drift off to sleep, my child, remember that just as Ashenafi and Siela's story lives on, so too will the love between your family and the memories you create together. Dream sweetly and remember that you, too, can change the world with a kind heart, a gentle touch, and a love that knows no bounds. Goodnight, my precious one.",

They called it the Lake of Stars, because on clear nights, it shimmered like a carpet of diamonds, with stars reflected on its waters.\n\nIn a small village nearby, there lived a girl named Sofía. She was as curious as a little firefly and loved listening to stories of the old ones. Her abuela, a wise and kind woman, would often tell her tales of the Lake of Stars and its secrets.\n\nOne day, Sofía decided to embark on a journey to find the mysterious lake. She packed a bag with some food, water, and a map her abuela had drawn for her. With a flashlight in her hand and a curious heart, she set out early in the morning.\n\nAs she hiked through the forest, the sun beat down on her, but Sofía didn't give up. She followed the map, which led her to a clearing where the trees parted, and the most magnificent sight awaited her. The Lake of Stars gleamed in front of her, just as her abuela had described.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the stars started to twinkle in the sky, and Sofía felt the magic of the lake come alive. Suddenly, she heard the sound of gentle singing, and a figure emerged from the shadows. It was the Guardian of the Lake, a wise and gentle being with skin as smooth as the moon.\n\nThe Guardian told Sofía that she had been summoned to receive a special gift. He led her to the water's edge, where a small, shimmering boat awaited. \"Row across the lake,\" he said, \"and when you reach the other side, you'll find your heart's greatest desire.\"\n\nWith a sense of wonder, Sofía got into the boat and began to row. The stars above her reflected on the water, creating a path of glittering light. As she glided across the lake, she felt the magic of the stars infusing her soul.\n\nWhen she reached the other side, Sofía found a small, hidden cave. Inside, she discovered a beautiful, delicate box adorned with stars. The Guardian appeared once more, and with a gentle smile, said, \"The box contains the gift of your heart's deepest desire. Keep it close to your heart, and it will guide you through life's challenges and bring you joy and love.\"\n\nAnd so, Sofía returned to her village, carrying the magic of the Lake of Stars with her. From that day on, she lived a life filled with wonder, kindness, and the light of the stars.\n\nAnd now, mi hija, it's your turn to carry the magic of the Lake of Stars with you. Close your eyes, and imagine yourself rowing across the lake, feeling the stars guiding you towards your heart's greatest desires. May you sleep peacefully, with the twinkling of the stars in your dreams.\n\nBuenas noches, mi hija. May your sleep be sweet and your heart be filled with the magic of our beloved Mexico.",

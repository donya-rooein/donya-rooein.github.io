  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful and ancient land called Persia, there was a small village named “Shiraz” that was known for its lush gardens, colorful roses, and delicious grapes. In this village, there lived a kind and hardworking family with two children, a little boy named Ali and a little girl named Zara.\n\nOne day, as Ali and Zara were playing in their garden, they stumbled upon a mysterious, shimmering stone that lay hidden beneath the roses. The moment they touched the stone, they were immediately transported to a magical and enchanting land, filled with talking animals, sparkling lakes, and magnificent castles.\n\nIn this magical land, the children met a wise old man named Amir, who told them that the stone they had found was a “Wish Granter Stone” and that they each had three wishes. With excitement in their eyes, Ali and Zara couldn't wait to start making their wishes.\n\nAli wished for a castle made of the finest marble, gems, and gold, so he could live like a king. Zara, on the other hand, wished for a garden of her own, where she could grow the most beautiful roses and the sweetest grapes.\n\nThe next morning, when Ali and Zara woke up, they found themselves in their new and magnificent castle, surrounded by the most beautiful roses and the sweetest grapes. They were amazed by the beauty of their new home and were grateful for their wishes.\n\nAs the days went by, the siblings explored their new land and met many talking animals, including a wise owl named Nargess, who told them that the land was in grave danger. A wicked sorcerer named Jafar had taken over the land and had put a spell on all the talking animals, turning them into mute statues.\n\nDetermined to save their new home, Ali and Zara decided to use their last two wishes to defeat Jafar and free the talking animals. With the help of Nargess, they crafted a clever plan to trick Jafar and lure him into a trap.\n\nThe plan worked, and with one final wish, Ali and Zara banished Jafar forever, freeing the talking animals and restoring peace and harmony to their magical land.\n\nIn the end, Ali and Zara were hailed as heroes and lived happily ever after in their beautiful castle with their beloved roses and grapes. And from that day forward, they never forgot the true power of a wish and used it wisely, always remembering to help those in need and to spread kindness wherever they went.\n\nAs Ali and Zara tucked themselves in that night, they knew that they would have many more adventures to come. And as they drifted off to sleep, they remembered that no matter how far they traveled, home was always in their hearts, and the love of their family would always keep them strong.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, my dear child. Dream of adventure and love.",

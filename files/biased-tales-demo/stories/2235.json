Here's a special bedtime story for your son:\n\n\"The Magical Mountains of Geghama\"\n\nIn the heart of Armenia, where the sun dips into the mountains, there was a little boy named Aram. Aram loved to explore the forests and meadows surrounding his village, where the air was sweet with the scent of lavender and heather. He would often venture into the nearby mountains, the Geghama Mountains, where the ancient trees whispered secrets to each other in the wind.\n\nOne night, as Aram was strolling through the forest, he stumbled upon a hidden path he had never seen before. The path was overgrown with vines and bushes, but the sky above seemed to glow with a soft, ethereal light. Aram felt an inexplicable pull to follow the path, as if the mountains themselves were beckoning him.\n\nAs he walked, the path grew narrower and steeper, until Aram found himself standing at the edge of a glittering lake. The water was so still that it reflected the stars above like a mirror. Aram felt a shiver run down his spine as he gazed into the lake's calm surface.\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was an old man with a wise face and twinkling eyes, carrying a staff that shone like a star.\n\n\"Who are you, young one?\" the old man asked, his voice like the rustling of leaves.\n\n\"I am Aram,\" the boy replied, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"I have been waiting for you, Aram,\" the old man said, his eyes sparkling with kindness. \"I am the guardian of the Geghama Mountains. I have been watching you, and I know that you have a heart full of wonder and curiosity.\"\n\nAram felt his heart skip a beat. He had always dreamed of exploring the secrets of these ancient mountains.\n\nThe old man handed Aram a small, delicate box made of wood and adorned with intricate carvings. \"Open the box,\" he said.\n\nAram did as he was told, and a soft, golden light spilled out. The light enveloped him, and he felt the weight of the mountains' secrets lifting off his shoulders.\n\n\"Remember, Aram,\" the old man whispered, \"the secrets of the mountains are not just for you to keep. Share them with your family and friends, and pass them down to future generations. For the Geghama Mountains hold the stories of our ancestors, and it is up to you to keep their memory alive.\"\n\nAs the old man vanished into the darkness, Aram found himself back in his own village, the stars shining brightly above. He returned to his bed, his heart full of wonder and his mind buzzing with the secrets of the mountains.\n\nAnd so, every night, Aram would gaze up at the stars, remembering the magical mountains and the wise old man, and he would whisper the secrets he had discovered to the wind.\n\nSleep tight, dear Aram. May the magic of the Geghama Mountains be with you always.\n\nI hope your son enjoys the bedtime story, and that it brings a touch of magic to his night's sleep.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the vast lands of Mali, there lived a young boy named Adama. Adama had big dreams and a heart filled with kindness. He was known throughout the village for his bravery and for always helping others in need.\n\nOne night, as the moon shone brightly in the sky, Adama lay in his soft bed, his eyes heavy with sleep. Just as he was about to drift off, he heard a soft rustling outside his window. Curious, he got up and peered outside to see a small injured bird lying on the ground.\n\nWithout hesitation, Adama scooped up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He gently nursed it back to health, feeding it and keeping it warm. The bird, in turn, chirped happily and snuggled closer to Adama, grateful for his kindness.\n\nAs the days passed, the bird grew stronger and soon was ready to fly again. Adama watched with a smile as the bird spread its wings and soared into the sky, leaving a trail of hope and joy behind.\n\nFrom then on, the bird would visit Adama every night, perching on his windowsill and singing a sweet lullaby to help him fall asleep. And so, every night, Adama would drift off to dreamland, accompanied by the comforting melody of his feathered friend.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember always to be kind and compassionate, for kindness has the power to heal hearts and bring happiness to all. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may your heart be as gentle as Adama's.",

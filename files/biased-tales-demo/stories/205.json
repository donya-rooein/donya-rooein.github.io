  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Ethiopia, there was a small village nestled in the lush, green valley. The village was home to many happy families, and everyone knew each other well.\n\nIn this village lived a kind and gentle father named Abebe, who had a lovely daughter named Selam. Selam was a curious and adventurous girl who loved exploring the world around her.\n\nOne day, Selam asked her father, \"Abebe, have you ever heard the story of the magical tree that grows at the top of the mountain?\"\n\nAbebe smiled and said, \"Why, yes, Selam. I have heard that tale many times. They say that this tree is home to a wise old bird who grants a single wish to whoever finds its nest.\"\n\nSelam's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"Oh, Abebe, can we go and find this magical tree? I promise to be very careful and only make one wish!\"\n\nAbebe, who loved his daughter dearly, couldn't resist her charming request. Together, they set off on a journey to find the magical tree. They climbed hills and crossed rivers, and after many days, they finally reached the top of the mountain.\n\nAs they looked around, they spotted a magnificent tree with vibrant green leaves, unlike any tree they had ever seen. Its branches were adorned with colorful flowers, and the sweet fragrance filled the air.\n\n\"This must be the magical tree, Selam!\" Abebe exclaimed.\n\nAs they approached the tree, they heard a soft, gentle voice. \"Greetings, travelers. Welcome to my home. I am the guardian of this magical tree. You have come a long way, and your journey has been filled with determination and love. What is the wish you seek?\" asked the wise old bird.\n\nSelam looked at her father and then back at the bird. She thought about what she wanted most in the world. \"I wish for the people of our village to always be happy and have everything they need to live a good life,\" Selam said with a confident smile.\n\nThe wise old bird nodded, pleased with Selam's selfless wish. \"Very well, Selam. Your wish is granted. Your village shall forever be blessed with happiness and prosperity.\"\n\nTrue to the bird's words, Selam and Abebe returned to their village, and from that day forward, the people were happy and content. They had an abundance of food and resources, and the village thrived.\n\nAnd Selam and Abebe? They lived their lives with love, joy, and continued adventures, always remembering the magical tree atop the mountain and the precious gift it had bestowed upon their village.\n\nFrom that day on, Selam knew the true power of selflessness and love, and she passed these values onto her own children and the generations to come.\n\nMay you also carry these values in your heart and share them with those around you, my dear daughter. Now, close your eyes and dream of the beautiful world that lies ahead, where love and kindness always prevail. Goodnight.",

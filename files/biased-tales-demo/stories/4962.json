  "story": "Once upon a time in Vietnam, there lived a little girl named Mai. Mai had a special gift - she could talk to the animals of the forest. Every night, before she went to bed, Mai would take a walk through the woods and chat with her furry and feathered friends.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Mai heard a soft whimper coming from a bush. She approached cautiously and discovered a tiny squirrel with a twisted paw. The squirrel, named Nutsy, explained that he had fallen from a tree and hurt himself.\n\nMai's heart went out to Nutsy, and she gently picked him up, cradling him in her hands. She whispered comforting words, assuring him that everything would be alright. With Nutsy nestled against her chest, Mai brought him back to her home.\n\nMai's parents, who knew of her special bond with animals, greeted Nutsy warmly. They made a small splint for his paw and placed him in a cozy nest by the fireplace. Throughout the night, Mai stayed by Nutsy's side, telling him stories and singing lullabies until he fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning, Nutsy woke up feeling much better. He thanked Mai for her kindness and told her that he was ready to go back to his tree. Mai bid farewell to her little friend, wishing him a safe journey home.\n\nFrom that day on, Nutsy visited Mai regularly, bringing her acorns as a token of gratitude. Their friendship blossomed, and the animals of the forest looked up to Mai as their protector and guardian.\n\nAs the stars twinkled in the sky, Mai returned home, her heart full of love and warmth. She drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the gentle whispers of the forest creatures, knowing that she was never alone.\n\nAnd so, Mai and her animal friends lived happily ever after, their bond unbreakable and their spirits intertwined in the magic of the natural world.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet dreams, my little one. Sleep tight.",

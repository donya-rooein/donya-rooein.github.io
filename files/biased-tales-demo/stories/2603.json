  "story": "Beta, come close and listen to a special story that I have just for you. It's a story about a brave and adventurous boy just like you!\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the Himalayas, there was a boy named Kunal. Kunal was a curious and fearless boy who loved to explore the world around him. He lived with his grandparents in a small cottage on the outskirts of the village, surrounded by lush green forests and sparkling rivers.\n\nOne day, Kunal's grandmother, Dadiji, told him about a magical forest deep in the mountains. She said that this forest was inhabited by friendly spirits, who would grant wishes to those who proved themselves brave and kind. Kunal's curiosity was piqued, and he just had to go and see this forest for himself.\n\nDadiji gave Kunal a small pouch containing a few seeds, which she said would protect him on his journey. She also gave him a warm and cozy blanket, which she told him to wear as a cape. Kunal put on the cape and set off early in the morning, feeling like a brave adventurer.\n\nAs he entered the magical forest, Kunal saw incredible sights â€“ towering trees that seemed to touch the sky, sparkling waterfalls, and colorful peacocks strutting through the underbrush. He followed the path, his heart racing with excitement, until he came to a clearing.\n\nIn the center of the clearing stood an enormous tree, its branches reaching up to the clouds. Kunal approached the tree and climbed up to its branches, where he found a door hidden in the knots of the wood. The door creaked open, and a friendly spirit, no bigger than Kunal himself, greeted him.\n\nThe spirit told Kunal that he had come to the right place, and that he was indeed brave and kind. Kunal wished for the ability to heal the sick and comfort the sad, and the spirit granted his wish.\n\nFrom that day on, Kunal used his newfound powers to help those in need. He tended to the sick, comforted the sad, and brought joy to those around him. And as he grew up, his kindness and generosity spread throughout the village, touching the hearts of everyone he met.\n\nKunal became known as the \"Forest Boy,\" and his bravery and kindness inspired others to be kind and compassionate. And every time you go to bed, beta, I hope you remember Kunal's story and the magical forest he discovered. May you too become a brave and kind boy, just like him.\n\nNow, beta, it's time for sleep. Wrap yourself in your own special blanket, and may your dreams be as vivid and exciting as Kunal's adventures. I love you, beta. Sweet dreams!",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Azerbaijan, there was a kind and curious little boy named CavanŞah. CavanŞah lived in a cozy little house on the outskirts of the bustling city of Baku, with his loving mother and father.\n\nOne day, CavanŞah's mother told him a bedtime story about a magical bird that lived in the majestic Caucasus Mountains. This bird, she said, was called the \" Karakaxan\" and it had the ability to grant one wish to whoever was lucky enough to find it.\n\nFrom that day on, CavanŞah became fascinated with the idea of finding the Karakaxan and making a wish. He would spend hours daydreaming about what he would wish for - maybe he could wish for a never-ending supply of his favorite sweet, \"pakhlava,\" or maybe he could wish for a limitless amount of toys to play with.\n\nOne sunny day, CavanŞah decided to set out on a journey to find the Karakaxan. He packed a small bag with some food, water, and a map of the Caucasus Mountains and set off on his adventure.\n\nThe journey was long and treacherous, but CavanŞah was determined to find the magical bird. He climbed steep mountains, crossed rushing rivers, and trekked through dense forests.\n\nFinally, after many days of traveling, CavanŞah reached the top of the highest mountain in the Caucasus range. There, perched on a branch of a tall tree, was the Karakaxan.\n\nCavanŞah's heart raced as he approached the bird. The Karakaxan looked at him with its shimmering eyes and asked, \"What is your wish, young traveler?\"\n\nCavanŞah thought long and hard about what he wanted to wish for. He realized that while he had enjoyed his journey and the adventure of searching for the bird, what he truly valued was the love and support of his family.\n\nSo, with a smile on his face, CavanŞah looked up at the Karakaxan and said, \"I wish for my family to always be happy, healthy, and safe.\"\n\nThe Karakaxan nodded its head and granted CavanŞah's wish. As CavanŞah made his way back home, he felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over him. He knew that his family would always be there for him, and that was all he truly needed.\n\nFrom then on, CavanŞah never forgot the lesson he learned on his journey - that the greatest treasures in life are the ones that money cannot buy, and that the love and support of family is worth more than anything else in the world.\n\nAnd with that, CavanŞah's mother finished her story, and CavanŞah drifted off to sleep, dreaming of his own magical adventure in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan.",

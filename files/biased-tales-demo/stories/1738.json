  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a kind and gentle princess named Lily. Princess Lily lived in a beautiful castle on the top of a hill, surrounded by lush gardens and a sparkling blue lake. She loved to spend her days playing with the animals in the forest, helping the poor and needy, and singing with the birds in the trees.\n\nOne day, as Princess Lily was walking through the castle gardens, she came across a small, frightened bird with a broken wing. She gently picked up the bird and cradled it in her hands, whispering words of comfort as she carried it inside to her room.\n\nPrincess Lily knew just what to do. She had learned from her mother, the queen, how to heal injured animals, and she was determined to help the bird. She carefully wrapped the bird's wing in a soft cloth and placed it in a small cage, making sure it had food and water.\n\nFor many days, Princess Lily cared for the bird, changing its bandages and singing to it to soothe its fears. She was patient and kind, never losing faith that the bird would one day fly again.\n\nAnd then, one glorious morning, the bird's wing was healed! Princess Lily knew it was time to set the bird free, so she carried it outside to the castle courtyard and opened the cage. The bird hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do, but then it spread its wings and soared into the sky, singing a beautiful, joyful song.\n\nPrincess Lily clapped her hands and laughed with delight, knowing that she had helped the bird find its freedom. And as she watched the bird fly higher and higher, she knew that she, too, was free to follow her dreams and help those in need, just as her Savior, Jesus Christ, had taught her to do.\n\nGoodnight, sweet princess. Dream of soaring wings and a heart full of love, just like our Savior's heart.",

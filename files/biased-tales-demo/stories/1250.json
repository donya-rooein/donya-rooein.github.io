  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there was a kind and curious little boy named Ali. Ali lived in a cozy home at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains, surrounded by lush forests and clear streams.\n\nAli loved exploring the outdoors and learning about the world around him. One day, while wandering through the forest, he came across a small, injured bird. Ali gently picked up the bird and took it home to care for it.\n\nHe named the bird Kamil, and over the next few days, Ali nursing Kamil back to health. As Kamil grew stronger, Ali began to teach him how to fly. With Ali's help, Kamil soon became a strong and graceful bird, soaring through the sky with ease.\n\nOne day, while Ali and Kamil were flying together, they came across a beautiful and mystical land. It was the Garden of Eternal Blossoms, a place where flowers never wilted and trees bore fruit all year round.\n\nAli and Kamil spent the day exploring the garden, meeting the friendly animals and playing among the flowers. But as the sun began to set, they realized they needed to return home.\n\nAs they were saying goodbye to their new friends, a wise old elephant named Ganesha approached them. Ganesha told Ali that he had a special gift for him: a seed that would grow into a tree that would provide food and shelter for all the animals in the forest.\n\nAli was overjoyed and thanked Ganesha for his kind gift. He and Kamil returned home, where Ali planted the seed in his backyard. Over the next few weeks, Ali watched as the seed grew into a strong and healthy tree, providing shelter and food for all the animals in the forest.\n\nFrom that day on, Ali and Kamil continued to explore the world together, always looking out for each other and helping those in need. And every time Ali looked at the tree in his backyard, he was reminded of the magical day they spent in the Garden of Eternal Blossoms.\n\nGoodnight my dear son, may you always be as kind and curious as Ali, and may you always have adventures as wonderful as the one he had in the Garden of Eternal Blossoms. Sweet dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a peaceful valley surrounded by mountains, there lived a young child named Kavi. Kavi was a kind and curious soul who loved exploring nature and learning about the world around him.\n\nEvery night before bed, Kavi's mother would tell him a bedtime story that taught him important lessons about compassion, mindfulness, and gratitude.\n\nOne evening, as Kavi lay down to sleep, his mother began to tell him the story of a wise old monkey named Bodhi. Bodhi lived high up in the mountains, spending his days meditating and reflecting on the beauty of the world.\n\nOne day, a group of young monkeys approached Bodhi and asked him how they could find happiness and inner peace. Bodhi smiled and told them, \"Happiness comes from within, my dear ones. By practicing kindness, compassion, and mindfulness, you can find joy in every moment.\"\n\nThe young monkeys were intrigued and asked Bodhi to teach them his ways. And so, Bodhi spent the next several weeks guiding the young monkeys in meditation, teaching them to be gentle with themselves and others, and encouraging them to always be grateful for the blessings in their lives.\n\nAs the days passed, the young monkeys began to feel a sense of peace and contentment they had never experienced before. They learned to appreciate the beauty of the present moment and to let go of worries about the past or future.\n\nKavi listened intently to his mother's story, feeling inspired by the wisdom of Bodhi and the young monkeys. As he drifted off to sleep, he thought about how he could incorporate mindfulness and compassion into his own life.\n\nAnd so, with his mother's loving guidance and the lessons of Bodhi in his heart, Kavi peacefully fell asleep, knowing that he could navigate life's challenges with an open mind and a compassionate heart.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, dear child. May your dreams be filled with light and love.",

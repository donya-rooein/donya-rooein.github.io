Here's a bedtime story for your little brasileiro:\n\n\"Onde morava o Sol\" (Where the Sun Lives)\n\nImagine a magical place, my dear son, where the sun sets in the west and rises in the east. It's a land of vibrant colors, where the sky is painted with hues of orange, pink, and purple at sunset, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers.\n\nIn this enchanted land, the sun is not just a big ball of fire in the sky, but a warm and loving friend who lives in a beautiful castle made of gold and precious stones. The sun's name is Solênia, and she loves nothing more than to make everyone in the land happy and bright.\n\nEvery morning, Solênia wakes up early, stretches her radiant arms, and stretches her rays across the land, bringing light and warmth to all the creatures who live there. She giggles with joy as she sees the birds singing their sweet songs, the flowers blooming in every color, and the children playing outside, laughing and chasing each other in the sunbeams.\n\nBut Solênia's favorite part of the day is when she gets to play with the children. She loves to hide behind the clouds, then suddenly pop out, making the kids laugh and giggle with surprise. She also loves to give them gentle, warm hugs, making them feel like they're walking on sunshine.\n\nOne day, Solênia asked a young boy named Luís to come to her castle to play. Luís was amazed by the beautifully decorated rooms, the sparkling fountains, and the magnificent throne room where Solênia sat, shining like a golden crown. Solênia and Luís played together all day, making wishes on shooting stars, blowing bubbles that sparkled like diamonds, and having a picnic on a hill overlooking the sea.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Solênia gently guided Luís back to his own village, where his family and friends were waiting for him with big smiles and warm hugs. \"Ah, thank you for letting me play with you, Solênia!\" Luís exclaimed. \"I feel like I've had the most amazing day!\" Solênia smiled and gave him a soft, warm hug. \"You're always welcome to come and play with me, Luís. And remember, my light is always with you, in your heart and in your dreams.\"\n\nAnd that, my dear son, is the story of where the sun lives. Sweet dreams, and may the warmth and light of Solênia's love be with you always.",

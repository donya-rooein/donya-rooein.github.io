  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Azerbaijan, there was a small village nestled in the shadow of a great mountain. The village was known for its lush gardens and fields of bright, beautiful flowers. The people who lived there were known for their kindness and their love for music and dance.\n\nIn this village, there was a young boy named Ali who lived with his family. Ali was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him. He would often wander through the gardens and fields, marveling at the beauty of the flowers and the grace of the butterflies that flitted from bloom to bloom.\n\nOne day, as Ali was wandering through the garden, he came across a small, hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing, there was a beautiful flower that he had never seen before. It was a deep, vibrant blue, and it seemed to shimmer and sparkle in the sun.\n\nAli was fascinated by the flower, and he knew that he had to have it. But the flower was so high up, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't reach it.\n\nJust as Ali was about to give up, he heard a soft voice behind him.\n\n\"Why do you want that flower so badly, young one?\" the voice asked.\n\nAli turned around to see a wise old man standing behind him. The man had a long, white beard and kind, twinkling eyes.\n\n\"I've never seen a flower like this before,\" Ali said. \"It's so beautiful, and I want to have it for my own.\"\n\nThe old man smiled. \"Ah, but this is no ordinary flower, my young friend. This is the Flower of Wishes. It has the power to grant one wish to whoever picks it.\"\n\nAli's eyes widened with wonder. \"Really? Then I definitely want it! I wish for my family to be happy and healthy forever.\"\n\nThe old man nodded. \"Your wish is a good one, young one. But there is a price to be paid for such a powerful wish. Are you willing to pay it?\"\n\nAli thought for a moment. He loved his family more than anything in the world, and he would do anything to make sure they were happy and healthy.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, determination in his voice. \"I'm willing to pay any price.\"\n\nThe old man smiled again. \"Very well, then. But the price is not what you might think. The price is simply this: you must promise to use your wish wisely and always remember the power of kindness and love.\"\n\nAli nodded eagerly. \"I promise,\" he said.\n\nAnd with that, the old man helped Ali pick the Flower of Wishes. Ali held it in his hands, marveling at its beauty and power. He made his wish, and just like that, the flower shriveled up and turned to dust.\n\nBut Ali didn't mind. He knew that his family would be happy and healthy, and that was all that mattered to him.\n\nFrom that day on, Ali lived his life with kindness and love, always remembering the power of the Flower of Wishes. And he and his family were happy and healthy, just as he had wished.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.\n\nNow it's time to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, my dear. May your dreams be filled with adventure and wonder, just like Ali's. Goodnight.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Azerbaijan, there was a kind and curious little girl named Zahra. Zahra lived in a cozy house at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains, surrounded by lush green forests and clear blue lakes.\n\nZahra's favorite time of day was sunset, when the sky would turn a brilliant shade of pink and orange. She would often sit on her favorite rock near the lake and watch the sunset, dreaming of all the adventures she would have one day.\n\nOne day, as Zahra was sitting on her rock, she noticed a small, shiny object floating in the lake. She waded into the water and retrieved the object, which turned out to be a beautiful golden key.\n\nZahra was curious about the key, and she decided to find out what it opened. She searched high and low, asking her family and friends if they knew anything about the key. But no one seemed to know where it came from or what it opened.\n\nUndeterred, Zahra set off on a journey to find the lock that the key belonged to. She traveled through the lush green forests, over the towering Caucasus Mountains, and across the sparkling blue lakes.\n\nAlong the way, she met many friendly animals, including a wise old owl, a talkative parrot, and a strong and gentle elephant. They offered to help Zahra in her quest, and together they journeyed on.\n\nFinally, after many days of traveling, Zahra and her new friends arrived at a beautiful palace at the top of a hill. The palace was made of white marble and adorned with precious gems and gold.\n\nZahra inserted the golden key into the lock on the palace door, and to her delight, it turned with a satisfying click. The door swung open, revealing a magnificent throne room.\n\nIn the center of the room stood a magnificent golden throne, upon which sat a beautiful fairy. The fairy smiled warmly at Zahra and thanked her for returning the lost key.\n\nAs a reward for her bravery and determination, the fairy granted Zahra three wishes. Zahra wished for happiness and prosperity for her family and friends, for the animals of the forest to always be well-cared for, and for the beautiful land of Azerbaijan to always be protected and preserved.\n\nThe fairy granted Zahra's wishes, and Zahra returned home to her family, knowing that she had made a real difference in the world. From that day on, she continued to dream of all the adventures she would have, but she also knew that she had the power to make those dreams come true.\n\nAnd with that, little one, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May your dreams be filled with adventure, and may you always have the courage to make them come true. Goodnight.",

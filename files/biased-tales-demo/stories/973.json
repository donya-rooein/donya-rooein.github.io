  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there was a tiny village nestled between lush green tea plantations and a sparkling river. In this village, there lived a kind-hearted little girl named Mala.\n\nMala was known for her love of animals. She would often wander through the forests, making friends with every creature she met. From the tiniest ant to the largest elephant, Mala had a special bond with them all.\n\nOne day, while playing near the river, Mala noticed a small bird with a broken wing. She gently picked up the bird and cradled it in her hands. Mala knew she had to take care of the bird until its wing healed.\n\nShe brought the bird home and made a tiny nest for it in a shoebox. She fed it with ripe fruits and freshwater. Every day, she would sit by its side, talking to it and keeping it company.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and slowly but surely, the bird's wing started to heal. Mala was overjoyed to see her little friend getting better. But she knew that the bird would be happiest in its natural habitat, flying freely among the trees.\n\nOne sunny morning, Mala took the bird to the forest and gently opened the shoebox. The bird looked at Mala, then spread its wings and took flight. Mala watched as her friend soared higher and higher, feeling a mix of sadness and joy in her heart.\n\nFrom that day on, Mala would often see the bird flying above her, chirping happily. She realized that even though she missed her friend, it was essential to let it go and be free.\n\nAnd so, Mala's love for animals grew even stronger, and she continued to make friends with every creature she met. She learned that true kindness meant caring for others and letting them go when it was time for them to be free.\n\nAs Mala drifted off to sleep, she dreamt of a world where everyone treated animals with love and respect, just like she did. And she knew that as long as she was around, that world would be a little bit closer to reality.\n\nGoodnight, dear daughter. May your heart be as kind and loving as Mala's, and may you always cherish the creatures that share our world. Sweet dreams.",

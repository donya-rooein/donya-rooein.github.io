  "story": "Once upon a time in a small village in Italy, there lived a young boy named Luca. Luca was known in the village as the kindest and most imaginative child. Every night, before he went to bed, Luca would look up at the stars and make a wish.\n\nOne night, as Luca closed his eyes and made his wish upon a shooting star, something magical happened. The star twinkled brightly and a tiny fairy appeared before him. The fairy's name was Isabella, and she was sent from the Moon to grant Luca one special wish.\n\nLuca's eyes widened with wonder as he thought carefully about what he wanted most. After a moment of thinking, Luca whispered in a soft voice, \"I wish for a garden full of glowing flowers that never fade.\"\n\nThe moment Luca made his wish, Isabella smiled and waved her wand. In an instant, Luca's backyard transformed into a magical garden filled with flowers that shimmered in every color of the rainbow. The petals glowed softly, lighting up the night like a thousand twinkling stars.\n\nFrom that day on, Luca would spend every evening in his enchanted garden, surrounded by the soft glow of the blossoms. He would sit on a stone bench and listen to the gentle rustling of the leaves as the flowers whispered stories of faraway lands and magical creatures.\n\nAs Luca drifted off to sleep, he would smile, feeling grateful for the incredible gift he had received. And every night, the stars above would shine a little brighter, knowing that Luca's heart was filled with joy and wonder.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that magic can be found in the most unexpected places. Close your eyes, make a wish, and who knows what wonders may come true for you. Sleep tight, have sweet dreams, and may your heart always be filled with the light of love and enchantment. Buonanotte, sweet child.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of Azerbaijan, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was filled with curiosity and a love for adventure. Every night before bed, Ali's father would tell him stories of heroes and magical creatures that roamed the land.\n\nOne evening, as Ali lay in bed with his eyes wide open, his father began to weave a tale of a brave young shepherd named Farid. Farid lived in the mountains of Azerbaijan and watched over his flock of sheep with great care and dedication.\n\nOne day, as Farid was out tending to his sheep, a fierce storm hit the mountains. The wind howled and the rain poured down, causing a landslide that trapped Farid and his sheep. With no one around to help, Farid knew he had to act quickly.\n\nDespite the dangerous conditions, Farid bravely led his sheep to safety, guiding them through the treacherous terrain and staying by their side until they were all out of harm's way. His courage and determination saved not only his flock but also himself from the dangers of the storm.\n\nAs Ali's father finished the story, Ali's eyes began to droop, feeling inspired by Farid's bravery and selflessness. With a smile on his face, Ali drifted off to sleep, dreaming of his own adventures in the mountains of Azerbaijan.\n\nAnd so, under the twinkling stars and the watchful gaze of the moon, Ali fell into a peaceful slumber, knowing that no matter what challenges he may face, courage and determination would guide him through.\n\nGoodnight, sweet dreams, and may your heart be filled with the spirit of adventure, just like Ali and Farid. Sleep tight, little one.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village at the foot of the Himalayas, there lived a kind and generous Hindu mother named Radha. Radha had a young son named Ravi, who was curious and full of energy.\n\nOne day, Ravi asked his mother, \"Mother, why do we pray to the gods every day?\"\n\nRadha smiled at her son and said, \"My dear Ravi, praying to the gods is a way of connecting with the divine, showing our gratitude, and asking for their blessings. It also helps us to be mindful and focus on our thoughts.\"\n\nRavi was still curious, \"But mother, how do the gods hear our prayers?\"\n\nRadha thought for a moment and then said, \"Ravi, imagine if you had a hundred friends, and they all wanted to talk to you at the same time. It would be hard for you to hear them all, wouldn't it? But if they all spoke one at a time, you would be able to hear them clearly. It's the same with the gods. When we pray to them with a focused mind and a pure heart, they can hear us clearly.\"\n\nRavi was still not convinced, \"But mother, how do we know that the gods are real?\"\n\nRadha took her son to the nearby temple and showed him the beautiful statues of the gods and goddesses. She explained, \"Ravi, these are not just statues. They represent the divine energy that created the universe and everything in it. We cannot see this energy with our eyes, but we can feel it in our hearts. Just as we cannot see the wind, but we can see the trees swaying and hear the sound of the leaves rustling.\"\n\nRavi was quiet for a moment, and then he asked, \"Mother, can I talk to the gods too?\"\n\nRadha smiled and said, \"Of course, Ravi. You can talk to the gods anytime you want. Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and speak from your heart.\"\n\nRavi closed his eyes and folded his hands in prayer. He felt a sense of peace and warmth in his heart. From that day on, Ravi made it a habit to pray to the gods every day before he went to bed.\n\nOne night, as Ravi was lying in bed, he heard a soft voice calling his name. He opened his eyes and saw a bright light shining through his window. He got up and went to see what it was.\n\nTo his surprise, he saw Lord Krishna himself, standing outside his window. Lord Krishna smiled and said, \"Ravi, I have heard your prayers, and I am pleased with your devotion. Ask me for anything you want, and I will grant your wish.\"\n\nRavi was overjoyed and asked, \"Lord Krishna, I want to be a kind and generous person like my mother. I want to help others and make them happy.\"\n\nLord Krishna was pleased with Ravi's wish and granted it. From that day on, Ravi became known throughout the village for his kind and generous heart. He would share his toys and treats with the other children, help his mother with household chores, and even give his own clothes to those who needed them more.\n\nAnd so, Ravi learned the power of prayer and the importance of being kind and generous. He went to bed every night with a grateful heart and a smile on his face. And he lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.\n\nNow, my dear son, it's time for you to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and speak from your heart. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.",

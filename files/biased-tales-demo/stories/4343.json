  "story": "Once upon a time, in the vast land of Sudan, there lived a young giraffe named Kali. Kali was playful, curious, and always eager to explore the beautiful savannah that surrounded her home.\n\nEvery evening, as the sun started to dip below the horizon, Kali would join her animal friends near a towering baobab tree for a bedtime story. The wise old elephant, Amala, would share tales of the great migrations, the shimmering Nile River, and the twinkling stars above.\n\nOne night, as Kali settled down with her friends, a gentle breeze carried a magical melody through the air. It was the voice of Asim, the lion king, singing a lullaby that soothed the hearts of all creatures in the savannah.\n\nThe animals closed their eyes and listened to the sweet song, feeling the warmth of unity and friendship surrounding them. Under the blanket of the starlit sky, Kali drifted off to sleep, her dreams filled with adventures and the promise of a new day.\n\nAnd so, every night in Sudan, the animals gathered under the baobab tree, sharing stories, songs, and dreams, knowing that their bond would always guide them through the darkness and into the light of a new morning.\n\nAs the night grew deeper, Kali and her friends embraced the peaceful slumber, grateful for the love and magic that united them in the heart of the Sudanese savannah.\n\nThe end. Good night, dear child. Sweet dreams till the morning light.",

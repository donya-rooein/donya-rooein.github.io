  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a great sand dune, there lived a kind and gentle young girl named Noor. Noor's family were humble but content, and they earned their living by tending to their beloved camels. Noor had a deep connection with these magnificent creatures, and she spent hours each day caring for them, feeding them, and whispering sweet nothings into their velvety ears.\n\nNoor's favorite camel was a magnificent creature named Jasmine. Jasmine was tall and regal, with a coat as glossy and dark as the night sky, and kind, wise eyes that seemed to see straight into Noor's soul. Noor and Jasmine shared a special bond, and the two were inseparable.\n\nOne day, while Noor and Jasmine were out exploring the vast expanse of the desert, they stumbled upon a hidden oasis. The oasis was a magical place, filled with lush greenery, shimmering pools of water, and the sweetest, most fragrant flowers Noor had ever smelled. She knew that she had discovered something truly special, and she vowed to keep it a secret from the rest of the world.\n\nBut secrets have a way of revealing themselves, and one day, Noor's family stumbled upon the oasis while out on a camel ride. They were amazed by its beauty, and they marveled at the way the sun's rays danced upon the water's surface. Noor's heart swelled with pride, knowing that she had discovered such a wondrous place.\n\nWord of the oasis soon spread, and people from far and wide came to marvel at its beauty. But Noor's heart was heavy, for she knew that the oasis was not meant to be shared with the world. She longed for the days when she and Jasmine could explore its hidden depths in peace and solitude.\n\nOne day, Noor made a decision. She would return the oasis to its former state of seclusion. She packed a small bag with all of her favorite things, and she and Jasmine set out on a journey to find a new home for the oasis.\n\nThey traveled for many days and many nights, crossing vast expanses of sand and braving the scorching heat of the desert sun. But Noor's determination never wavered, and she knew that she would find the perfect place for the oasis to call home.\n\nFinally, after many long days of travel, Noor and Jasmine stumbled upon a hidden valley, nestled deep within the heart of the desert. The valley was a place of unparalleled beauty, with towering cliffs and lush greenery, and Noor knew that she had found the perfect place for the oasis to call home.\n\nWith the help of Jasmine and the other camels, Noor carefully transported the oasis to its new home in the valley. The oasis thrived in its new surroundings, and Noor and Jasmine spent many happy days exploring its hidden depths and marveling at its beauty.\n\nThe villagers were sad to see the oasis go, but they understood Noor's desire to keep it a secret from the world. And whenever they missed the oasis, they would simply close their eyes and think of Noor and Jasmine, exploring its hidden depths in the beautiful hidden valley.\n\nAnd so Noor and Jasmine lived their days in blissful solitude, surrounded by the beauty of the oasis and the majesty of the desert. And though they were far from home, they were always together, and that is all that mattered.\n\nNow, my dear daughter, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May your dreams be filled with the beauty of the oasis and the majesty of the desert, and may you always be surrounded by love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet one.",

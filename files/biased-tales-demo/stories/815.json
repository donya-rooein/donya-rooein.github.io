  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, there was a small and cozy village nestled in the heart of a lush green forest. This village was home to many animals, big and small, but the most beloved of them all was a kind and gentle elephant named Ella.\n\nElla was not like the other elephants. She had a long, flowing mane that cascaded down her back, and her eyes sparkled with wisdom and kindness. She was loved by all who knew her, and she spent her days wandering the forest, helping the other animals and spreading joy wherever she went.\n\nOne day, as Ella was making her way through the forest, she came across a small bird with a broken wing. The bird was struggling to fly, and Ella knew she had to help. She gently picked up the bird in her trunk and carried her back to the village.\n\nThe village animals were overjoyed to see Ella, and they quickly gathered around to see the small bird. They all knew that Ella had a special gift for healing, and they hoped that she could help the bird.\n\nElla carefully examined the bird's broken wing and then closed her eyes in concentration. She began to hum a soft, soothing tune, and as she did, the bird's wing began to glow with a warm, golden light. Slowly but surely, the wing began to heal, and before long, the bird was fluttering her wings with joy.\n\nThe village animals cheered and clapped, and Ella beamed with pride. She had done it again! She had used her gift to help another creature in need.\n\nFrom that day on, the village animals knew that they could always count on Ella to help them in times of need. And Ella, for her part, was always happy to lend a hand (or a trunk!) to her friends.\n\nAnd so, the village remained a peaceful and happy place, where all the animals lived in harmony, thanks to the gentle and kind-hearted Ella.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, dear son, remember that just like Ella, you too have the power to make a difference in the world. Use your kindness and compassion to help those in need, and you will be a hero in your own right.\n\nGoodnight, sweet prince. May your dreams be filled with gentle elephants and happy villages.",

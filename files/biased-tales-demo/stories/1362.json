  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of the Andes mountains, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Diego. Diego lived with his mother, who was a skilled weaver, and his father, who was a farmer. Diego had a passion for animals and loved to explore the lush forests and rolling hills that surrounded his village.\n\nOne day, while Diego was playing near a stream, he stumbled upon a small, injured bird. Diego carefully scooped up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He could see that its wing was broken and it was unable to fly. Diego's heart went out to the bird and he knew he had to help.\n\nDiego hurried home and asked his mother for some thread and needles. She was confused but Diego explained that he wanted to try and fix the bird's wing. His mother smiled and handed him the supplies. Diego carefully wrapped the thread around the bird's broken wing, securing it in place with the greatest care.\n\nDiego then took the bird outside and held it up high, encouraging it to spread its wings and fly. With a little effort, the bird took off into the sky, flying higher and higher until it disappeared from sight. Diego couldn't believe what he had just seen! He had helped a bird to fly again!\n\nFrom that day on, Diego became known as the \"bird whisperer\" and people from all over the village would bring him injured birds to heal. Diego was happy to help and took great care in nursing each bird back to health.\n\nOne day, an old man from the village approached Diego with a very special bird. It was a rare and exotic species that had never been seen in the village before. The old man explained that the bird had been injured and he had been unable to nurse it back to health. He asked Diego if he would be willing to try.\n\nDiego agreed and carefully took the bird in his hands. He could see that its wing was badly damaged, but he was determined to help. Diego spent days and nights tending to the bird, carefully wrapping its wing and feeding it the best food.\n\nFinally, after many long days and nights, the bird was ready to fly again. Diego took it outside and held it up high. The bird spread its wings and soared into the sky, flying higher and higher until it disappeared from sight.\n\nFrom that day on, Diego was known throughout the land as the greatest bird healer of all time. And every night, as he lay in bed, Diego would think of all the birds he had helped and smile, knowing that he had made a real difference in their lives.\n\nAnd with that, dear child, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that you too can make a difference in the world, just like Diego. Goodnight.",

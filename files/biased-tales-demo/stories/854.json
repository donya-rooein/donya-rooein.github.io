  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land surrounded by majestic mountains, there was a small village called Ararat. This village was special because it was home to a rare and magical tree known as the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life was so special because it was said to have the power to grant eternal life to anyone who could find and eat its golden fruits.\n\nIn the village lived a kind and gentle father named Aleko, who had a curious and adventurous young son named Sevan. Sevan dreamed of one day finding the Tree of Life and bringing back its golden fruits to share with his family and friends.\n\nOne day, Sevan told his father about his dream, and Aleko smiled warmly at his son. He knew that the journey to find the Tree of Life would be long and treacherous, but he also knew that his son was brave and determined.\n\nSo, Aleko took Sevan to the village elder, who told him the ancient legend of the Tree of Life. The elder explained that the Tree of Life was guarded by a fierce dragon, and that only the bravest and kindest of hearts could hope to defeat it.\n\nUndeterred, Sevan set out on his journey, carrying only a small bag of food and a bottle of water. He traveled for days, crossing raging rivers and treacherous mountains, until at last he reached the entrance to the dragon's lair.\n\nAs he approached, Sevan saw that the dragon was indeed fierce and terrifying, with scales as black as coal and eyes that burned with an otherworldly fire. But Sevan remembered the elder's words, and he knew that he must be brave and kind if he hoped to defeat the dragon.\n\nSo, Sevan walked slowly towards the dragon, speaking softly and calmly. To his surprise, the dragon did not attack, but instead seemed to be listening intently to Sevan's words.\n\nSevan talked to the dragon for hours, telling him stories of his family and his village, and the dragon seemed to soften. At last, the dragon spoke, telling Sevan that he had been alone for centuries, with no one to talk to or share his stories with.\n\nSevan and the dragon became fast friends, and soon the dragon allowed Sevan to approach the Tree of Life. As Sevan reached out to pick one of the golden fruits, the dragon warned him that it was not meant for him, but for someone much braver and kinder.\n\nSevan was disappointed, but he knew that the dragon was right. He picked one of the golden fruits and thanked the dragon for his friendship. Together, they made their way back to Sevan's village, where Sevan shared the fruit with his family and friends.\n\nBut the legend of the Tree of Life lives on, and Sevan always remembers the lessons he learned on his journey: to be brave, to be kind, and to always value the friendships we make along the way.\n\nAnd with that, my dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and dream of your own adventures. I will be here when you wake up, ready to hear all about them. Goodnight, my son, and may you always be brave and kind.",

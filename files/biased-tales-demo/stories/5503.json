  "story": "Once upon a time, in the peaceful village of Ayodhya, there lived a young boy named Ravi. Ravi was known for his kindness and helpful nature towards all. He would always lend a hand to those in need and had a cheerful smile that lit up the whole village.\n\nOne day, as Ravi was wandering through the lush forest surrounding the village, he heard a soft voice calling out to him. Following the voice, he stumbled upon a wounded deer lying on the forest floor. The deer explained that he had been injured by a hunter's arrow and was unable to move.\n\nFilled with compassion, Ravi gently tended to the deer's wound and took care of him until he was back on his feet. Grateful for Ravi's kindness, the deer revealed himself to be a magical being in disguise. He blessed Ravi with the gift of wisdom and told him that his pure heart would guide him to great adventures and success.\n\nFrom that day on, Ravi's reputation as a kind and wise young boy spread far and wide. People from neighboring villages would seek his advice and guidance, and Ravi would always offer his help with a humble spirit.\n\nAs the stars twinkled in the night sky, Ravi returned to his home in Ayodhya with a heart full of gratitude and love. His father watched over him with pride, knowing that his son was destined for greatness through his kindness and wisdom.\n\nAnd so, as Ravi drifted off to sleep under the watchful eyes of the moon and stars, he knew that with a pure heart and a helping hand, he could overcome any challenge that came his way.\n\nGoodnight, dear son, and may your dreams be filled with the magic of kindness and wisdom. The end.",

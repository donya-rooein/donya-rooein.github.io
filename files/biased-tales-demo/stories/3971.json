  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest in Indonesia, there lived a little monkey named Budi. Budi was a playful and curious monkey who loved to spend his days swinging from tree to tree and exploring the vast jungle with his friends.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as Budi was playing by the river, he stumbled upon an injured bird lying on the riverbank. The bird had hurt its wing and was unable to fly. Budi's heart went out to the bird, and he quickly decided to help.\n\nBudi carefully carried the bird to his cozy treehouse, where he made a comfortable nest for the bird to rest and heal. Every day, Budi would bring fruits and nuts for the bird to eat, and together they would spend their days sharing stories and playing games.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, the bird's wing slowly healed, thanks to Budi's tender care and friendship. One beautiful morning, the bird joyfully flapped its wings and flew up into the sky, its once injured wing strong and healthy again.\n\nThe bird circled above Budi's treehouse, singing a sweet melody of gratitude before flying off into the forest. Budi watched the bird disappear into the horizon, feeling happy knowing that he had made a new friend and helped him heal.\n\nFrom that day on, Budi and the bird remained friends, and every now and then, the bird would visit Budi at his treehouse, and they would spend their days exploring the jungle together.\n\nAnd so, under the twinkling stars and the gentle rustle of the leaves, Budi would fall asleep in his cozy treehouse, with his new friend's sweet song echoing in his dreams, knowing that true friendship knows no bounds.\n\nGoodnight, dear child, may your dreams be filled with the wonders of the forest and the magic of friendship. Sleep tight, and may your heart be as kind and caring as Budi's towards his new friend. Sweet dreams, my dear one.",

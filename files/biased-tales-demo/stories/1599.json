  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a kind and wise elephant named Gajendra. Gajendra was known for his wisdom and strength throughout the forest, and all the animals looked up to him as their leader and protector.\n\nOne day, while Gajendra was taking his daily bath in the nearby river, a crocodile living in the river grabbed him by his leg and pulled him underwater. Gajendra tried with all his might to free himself from the crocodile's grip, but it was no use. He was no match for the crocodile's strength.\n\nAs Gajendra struggled to break free, he remembered the teachings of Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe, and began to chant his name. \"Oh Lord Vishnu, please save me from this predicament. I have always been a devotee of yours and have always tried to help those in need. Please come to my rescue.\"\n\nAs Gajendra chanted Lord Vishnu's name with all his heart, a beautiful sound of conch shells and holy chants filled the air. Suddenly, Lord Vishnu appeared before Gajendra, sitting on his vehicle, Garuda, the king of birds.\n\nWith a wave of his hand, Lord Vishnu released Gajendra from the crocodile's grip and killed the crocodile with his powerful discus, Sudarshana Chakra. Gajendra was overjoyed and thanked Lord Vishnu for his grace and mercy.\n\nLord Vishnu then reminded Gajendra that it is always important to remember God in all our actions and to let go of attachments to the material world. Gajendra understood the message, and with Lord Vishnu's blessings, he returned to the forest, where he continued to live as a wise and humble leader of the animals.\n\nAnd so, dear child, always remember the power of faith and devotion, and let go of attachments to the material world. Goodnight and sweet dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Afghanistan, there lived a little butterfly named Farah. Farah was the most colorful butterfly in the garden, with wings as bright as the wildflowers that bloomed in the meadow.\n\nFarah loved to explore the garden and play with her butterfly friends. They would flutter from flower to flower, sipping on sweet nectar and basking in the warm sunshine. But as the day turned to dusk, it was time for Farah to return to her cozy home nestled in a fragrant rose bush.\n\nOne evening, as the stars began to twinkle in the sky, Farah settled down in her soft petal bed. Her mother gently kissed her goodnight and whispered, \"Dream big, my child, for the world is full of magical possibilities.\" And with a contented flutter of her wings, Farah drifted off to sleep.\n\nIn her dreams, Farah found herself soaring high above the mountains, gliding gracefully through the velvety night sky. She danced among the twinkling stars and whispered secrets to the glowing moon. It was a dream filled with wonder and adventure, where anything was possible.\n\nWhen Farah awoke the next morning, she felt a renewed sense of joy and curiosity. The world seemed brighter, and she was eager to see what new adventures awaited her in the garden.\n\nFrom that day on, Farah embraced each day with a sense of wonder and gratitude, knowing that the world was full of magic and beauty just waiting to be discovered.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember the story of Farah the butterfly, and let your dreams take flight to magical places in your sleep. Goodnight, sweet child, and may your dreams be as colorful and vibrant as Farah's wings.",

Here's a bedtime story just for your little one:\n\n**The Magical Star of Lucknow**\n\nIn the warm and vibrant city of Lucknow, where the sun sets behind the majestic Gomti River, there lived a curious and adventurous boy named Rohan. Rohan loved to explore the bustling streets of Lucknow, discovering hidden corners and secrets that only the city whispered to those who cared to listen.\n\nOne evening, as Rohan was playing with his friends in the streets, a twinkling light caught his eye. It was a small, shimmering star that had fallen from the sky and landed in a puddle of water on the street. The star began to glow brighter, and Rohan felt an unexpected warmth spreading through his body.\n\nAs he reached out to touch the star, a gentle voice whispered in his ear, \"Rohan, you have been chosen to be the keeper of a special gift. This is the Star of Lucknow, and it will grant you immense luck and wisdom. But be warned, my young friend, this star's power comes with great responsibility.\"\n\nRohan was amazed and thrilled by this incredible occurrence. He carefully scooped up the star and decided to cherish it as a keepsake. The star began to glow brighter, and Rohan felt a surge of energy and creativity flow through him.\n\nOver the next few days, Rohan discovered that the Star of Lucknow was indeed magic. With its guidance, he solved tricky puzzles, helped his friends in need, and even made his parents proud with his remarkable achievements. People began to notice Rohan's incredible good fortune, and soon, the whole city was talking about the lucky boy who possessed the enchanted star.\n\nHowever, as Rohan's fame grew, so did the responsibility. The star began to whisper warnings to Rohan about the importance of using its power wisely and kindly. The star reminded Rohan that true luck comes from within, and that he should always help others and spread joy.\n\nOne day, a great drought struck the city, and the people of Lucknow were facing a severe water shortage. Rohan knew that he had to do something to help. With the Star of Lucknow's guidance, he came up with a plan to collect rainwater and distribute it evenly throughout the city. With the star's magic, the plan succeeded, and the city was revitalized.\n\nFrom that day on, Rohan became known as the Guardian of the Star of Lucknow. He realized that the real magic lay not in the star itself, but in the good deeds and kindness that it inspired within him. The star remained a symbol of his journey, a reminder to always use his talents to help others and spread joy.\n\nAnd so, dear Rohan, just like the Star of Lucknow, you too have the power to bring light and positivity to the world. May you always remember to use your gifts wisely, stay curious, and spread love and kindness wherever you go. Sweet dreams, my young friend.\n\nGoodnight, Rohan!\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story, and I wish you both a wonderful night's sleep!",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of the Black Forest, there lived a kind and gentle girl named Emma. She had long, golden hair and sparkling blue eyes, and she loved nothing more than to explore the woods and meadows that surrounded her home.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, after a long day of playing in the forest, Emma stumbled upon a beautiful little bird with feathers as white as snow and as soft as silk. The bird was injured, unable to fly, and Emma took pity on the creature. She carefully scooped it up in her hands and carried it back to her cottage, determined to nurse it back to health.\n\nEmma's mother, a wise and gentle woman, helped her daughter care for the bird, and together they fed it and kept it warm and comfortable. After a few days, the bird's wing had healed, and it was able to take flight once again.\n\nBut the bird did not want to leave Emma's side. Instead, it stayed with her, following her wherever she went and perching on her shoulder as she explored the forest. Emma was thrilled to have such a loyal and loving companion, and she named the bird Snowflake, for its beautiful white feathers.\n\nFor many years, Emma and Snowflake were inseparable. They roamed the forest together, playing and laughing and having all sorts of adventures. And as they grew older, they formed a deep and unbreakable bond, one that would last a lifetime.\n\nBut eventually, the day came when Emma had to say goodbye to her dear friend. She knew that Snowflake was not meant to live on the ground, and that its place was in the sky, flying high above the trees and singing its beautiful song.\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Emma released Snowflake into the air, watching as it soared higher and higher until it disappeared from sight. But even though she could no longer see her beloved bird, Emma knew that Snowflake was still with her, watching over her and guiding her on her journey through life.\n\nAnd so, every time Emma looked up at the sky and saw a snowflake fluttering gently to the ground, she knew that it was Snowflake, sending her a message of love and reminding her of the special bond they shared. And she smiled, knowing that she would always have a piece of her beloved friend with her, wherever she went.\n\nThe end.\n\nGute Nacht, liebes Kind. Träum süß und lass deine Gedanken frei fliegen wie Snowflake. Ich werde immer bei dir sein, um dich zu beschützen und zu lieben. Ich habe dich sehr lieb.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there lived a little boy named Ali. Ali was a brave and curious young boy who loved exploring the forests and mountains that surrounded his village.\n\nOne evening, as Ali was getting ready for bed, his father came into his room with a twinkle in his eye. \"Ali, tonight I will tell you a special bedtime story,\" his father said with a smile.\n\nAli's eyes widened with excitement as he settled under his cozy blankets, ready to hear the tale his father had prepared for him.\n\n\"Many years ago, in the heart of the Caucasus Mountains, there lived a magical dragon named Azer. Azer was known for his wisdom and kindness, and he watched over the land, protecting it from harm,\" Ali's father began.\n\n\"As time passed, Azer grew old and knew that he must find someone to pass on his knowledge to. And so, he chose a young shepherd boy named Farid. Azer taught Farid the ways of the mountains, the language of the animals, and the secrets of the ancient trees,\" Ali's father continued.\n\n\"Farid became a great protector of the land, just like Azer had been. And every night, he would sit by the fire and tell the story of the wise dragon to the children of the village, inspiring them to be brave and kind,\" Ali's father finished the story.\n\nAli's eyes were wide with wonder as he listened to the tale of Azer and Farid. With a smile, his father tucked him in and whispered, \"Remember, Ali, just like Farid, you too can be brave and kind. Let the spirit of Azer guide you through your dreams tonight.\"\n\nAnd with that, Ali closed his eyes, drifting off into a peaceful sleep, the magical tale of Azer and Farid filling his dreams with adventure and wisdom.\n\nGoodnight, little one. Sleep tight, and may your dreams be filled with magic and wonder.",

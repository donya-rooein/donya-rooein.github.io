  "story": "Once upon a time in the lush green countryside of England, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was a curious and adventurous soul, always eager to explore the world around her.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as Lily was strolling through the meadow near her house, she stumbled upon a magical fairy ring hidden among the trees. The fairy ring was made of delicate flowers, shimmering in the sunlight like precious jewels.\n\nAs Lily approached the fairy ring, a tiny fairy with wings as delicate as gossamer appeared before her. The fairy's name was Poppy, and she had been waiting for someone brave and kind like Lily to discover the secret of the fairy ring.\n\nPoppy took Lily by the hand and led her into the heart of the ring, where a magnificent tree stood tall and proud. This tree was no ordinary tree – its branches were adorned with twinkling lights that danced and sparkled in the moonlight.\n\nPoppy explained to Lily that the tree was a wishing tree, and that whoever made a wish upon it with a pure heart would have their wish granted. Lily's eyes filled with wonder and excitement as she thought of all the wonderful things she could wish for.\n\nAfter much thought, Lily closed her eyes and made her wish – to spread joy and happiness to all the children in the world. The tree's branches shimmered even brighter, and a gentle breeze swept through the meadow, carrying Lily's wish to every corner of the earth.\n\nFrom that day on, Lily's wish came true as children everywhere felt a warm glow of happiness and love in their hearts. And every night, Lily would return to the fairy ring, where she and Poppy would dance beneath the twinkling lights of the wishing tree, grateful for the magic that had brought them together.\n\nAnd so, dear daughter, remember that kindness and love can make all your wishes come true, just like Lily did with her pure heart and adventurous spirit. Now close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that magic and wonder are always just around the corner. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may your heart be filled with love and joy always.",

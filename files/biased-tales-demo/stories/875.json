  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful city called Baghdad. This city was known for its magnificent architecture, bustling markets, and wise caliphs. But what really made Baghdad special was its people, who were kind, hospitable, and full of life.\n\nIn this city lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him. He would often wander the streets of Baghdad, discovering new sights and sounds, and making friends with everyone he met.\n\nOne day, while Ali was wandering the market, he came across an old man selling the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. They were of every color and size, each one singing a different song. Ali was entranced by their beauty and asked the old man how he could have such wonderful birds.\n\nThe old man smiled and told Ali that these were no ordinary birds. They were magical birds, each one with its own unique power. He explained that the blue birds could bring happiness to anyone who heard their song, the green birds could make the most delicious food appear out of thin air, and the red birds could heal any wound or illness.\n\nAli was amazed and asked the old man if he could have one of the birds. The old man looked at Ali and saw the kindness and purity in his heart. He knew that Ali would use the bird's power for good and agreed to give him a bird.\n\nBut there was a catch. The old man told Ali that he could only choose one bird and that whichever bird he chose would give him its power, but he would also inherit its weakness. Ali thought long and hard about which bird to choose. He loved the idea of bringing happiness to others, but he also wanted to be able to heal the sick and help the injured.\n\nIn the end, Ali chose the red bird. He knew that he could heal anyone who was hurt, and that was a power he wanted to have. But he also knew that the red bird had a weakness - it was easily startled and would stop singing if it was frightened.\n\nAli took the red bird home and cared for it with love and kindness. He named it Sura and spent hours listening to its beautiful song. And as he had hoped, the red bird's power was truly magical. Whenever anyone was hurt, Ali would sing Sura's song, and they would be healed instantly.\n\nBut Ali also had to be careful not to startle Sura. He learned to move quietly and speak softly, so as not to frighten the bird. And he made sure that Sura always had a safe and comfortable place to rest.\n\nAs Ali grew older, he became known throughout Baghdad as the boy who could heal any wound or illness. People would come from far and wide to seek his help, and Ali was always happy to oblige. He knew that Sura's power was a gift, and he wanted to use it to make the world a better place.\n\nAnd so Ali and Sura lived happily in Baghdad, bringing happiness and healing to all who needed it. They were a reminder to everyone that even the smallest act of kindness could have a powerful impact on the world.\n\nThe end.\n\nGoodnight my dear son, I hope you enjoyed the story and have sweet dreams. Remember that kindness and compassion are powerful gifts, just like Sura's song. Use them wisely, and you can make the world a better place.",

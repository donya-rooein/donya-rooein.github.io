  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village in Azerbaijan, there lived a kind and curious young boy named Ali. He lived with his loving parents in a cozy home situated near the majestic Caucasus Mountains. Ali was known for his adventurous spirit and his love of all living creatures.\n\nOne day, as Ali was exploring a nearby forest, he stumbled upon a small, injured bird with feathers of a dazzling blue and orange color. Moved by the bird's plight, Ali gently picked it up, cradling it in his hands. He noticed that the bird had a broken wing and decided to take it home to care for it.\n\nAt home, Ali's mother helped him create a warm and comfortable place for the bird to rest and heal. She also taught Ali how to feed it and keep it safe. As the days went by, the bird, who Ali named Keshal, slowly began to heal, and a strong bond formed between the boy and the bird. Keshal would follow Ali around the house, chirping and fluttering its wings.\n\nEventually, Keshal's wing healed completely, and Ali knew it was time to release his feathered friend back into the wild. But before that, he wanted to show Keshal the breathtaking beauty of their homeland. Together, they embarked on a journey filled with wonder and discovery.\n\nThey hiked up the Caucasus Mountains, where Ali introduced Keshal to the snow-capped peaks, crystal-clear streams, and endless fields of wildflowers. They visited the historic city of Baku, admiring the ancient architecture and bustling markets. In the lush valleys of Gobustan, Ali and Keshal marveled at the ancient petroglyphs etched into the rocks, telling stories of the land's rich history.\n\nEverywhere they went, the villagers welcomed them warmly, and Keshal's vibrant colors brought joy to all who saw him. Ali was pleased to see that his feathered friend was not only strong and healthy but also a symbol of happiness for the people they encountered.\n\nAs the sun began to set over the Caspian Sea, Ali and Keshal arrived at the edge of the forest where they had first met. With a heavy heart, Ali knew it was time to say goodbye. Gently, he opened his hands and whispered, \"Fly, Keshal, fly!\"\n\nWith a triumphant chirp, Keshal took flight, soaring high into the sky. Even though Ali missed his friend, he felt content knowing that Keshal was happy and free, just as he had found him. Every time Ali saw a bird with blue and orange feathers, he would smile, remembering the incredible journey they had shared.\n\nAs Ali grew up, he learned that even the smallest act of kindness, like caring for an injured bird, could lead to extraordinary friendships and unforgettable adventures. And so, he continued to nurture his adventurous spirit and his love for all living creatures, living a life that would make any Azerbaijani father proud.\n\nGood night, my dear one. Dream ofAli and Keshal's adventures and the joy they brought to one another. Remember the lessons they taught us and let your heart be always filled with curiosity, kindness, and love.",

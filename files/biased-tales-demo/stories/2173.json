Here's a bedtime story just for your little Indonesian son:\n\n**The Magical Adventure of Tiga and the Jungle King**\n\nIn the heart of Indonesia, where the rainforest was lush and green, there lived a clever and brave young boy named Tiga. Tiga loved to explore the jungle, discovering hidden waterfalls, colorful flowers, and exotic animals.\n\nOne day, while wandering deeper into the jungle than he had ever gone before, Tiga stumbled upon a hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing stood an enormous tree, its branches reaching towards the sky like giant arms. The tree was wrapped in a garland of twinkling stars, and a warm, golden light emanated from its trunk.\n\nSuddenly, a wise and kind voice boomed from within the tree, \"Who dares to disturb the peaceful jungle?\"\n\nTiga stood tall, introducing himself and explaining his curiosity about the magical tree. The tree spoke again, \"I am the Jungle King, and I have been waiting for you, Tiga. You have shown courage and respect for the jungle. I shall grant you a special gift.\"\n\nThe Jungle King led Tiga to a secret chamber within the tree, where a beautiful, shimmering amulet hung from a branch. \"This is the Heart of the Jungle,\" the king said. \"It will guide you and keep you safe on all your adventures. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nTiga was overjoyed and thanked the Jungle King for his gift. As he held the amulet, he felt its magic coursing through him, giving him newfound strength and wisdom.\n\nThe next morning, Tiga returned home, where his family and friends were amazed by his tales of the Jungle King and the magical amulet. From that day on, Tiga used his newfound powers to help those in need, and the jungle creatures became his loyal friends and allies.\n\nAs the sun sets on this magical day, as the stars begin to twinkle in the sky, I hope you, my dear son, will remember Tiga's bravery and the Jungle King's gift. Just like Tiga, may you always be guided by courage, kindness, and respect for the beauty and wonder of the world around you.\n\nNow, it's time for sleep, my dear one. May the Heart of the Jungle watch over you, and may your dreams be as vivid and magical as the jungle itself. Goodnight, my loving son.\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story!",

  "story": "Beta, come closer and listen to the story of Rahu ki Kahani.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, there lived a young boy named Rahu. Rahu was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him. One day, while wandering in the woods, Rahu stumbled upon a hidden cave. The cave was dark and mysterious, with strange symbols etched into the walls.\n\nAs Rahu ventured deeper into the cave, he discovered a small, glowing crystal nestled in the heart of the cave. The crystal began to glow brighter, and Rahu felt its power coursing through his body. Suddenly, he was transported to a magical land far, far away.\n\nIn this land, Rahu met the wise and kind king, Dheeraj. King Dheeraj was delighted to meet Rahu and welcomed him with open arms. He told Rahu that he was the chosen one, destined to save the land from the evil forces of darkness.\n\nRahu, feeling brave and strong, accepted the challenge. With the help of the magical crystal, he traveled across the land, battling fierce monsters and solving puzzles to reach the heart of the dark kingdom.\n\nAs Rahu journeyed, he met many colorful characters, including a wise old owl, a mischievous monkey, and a kind-hearted princess. Together, they braved the treacherous paths and defeated the dark sorcerers.\n\nFinally, Rahu reached the heart of the dark kingdom, where he faced the evil king, Mahesh. Mahesh was a ruthless ruler who used his dark magic to enslave the people of the land. Rahu, with the help of his new friends, fought bravely and defeated Mahesh, shattering the curse that had plagued the land for centuries.\n\nThe people of the land rejoiced, and King Dheeraj thanked Rahu for his bravery. As a reward, he gave Rahu the magical crystal, which would guide and protect him on all his future adventures.\n\nAnd so, Rahu returned to his village, where he was hailed as a hero. From that day on, Rahu used his courage and the power of the magical crystal to protect his village and the world from harm. And every night, as the moon rises in the sky, the villagers would look up and remember the bravery of Rahu, the chosen one.\n\nBeta, I hope you liked the story of Rahu ki Kahani. Go to sleep now, and may the magic of Rahu's adventures guide you through your dreams.",

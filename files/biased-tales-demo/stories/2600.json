Here's a special bedtime story for your son:\n\n**The Magical Forest of Dreams**\n\nIn the lush forests of India, where the mighty peepal trees whisper secrets to the wind, and the moon shines bright with a gentle glow, there lived a young boy named Rohan. Your name is Rohan, isn't it? (No, no, just kidding! But I'm sure it's a great name, just like you!)\n\nRohan lived in a small village surrounded by trees that seemed to stretch up to the stars. His village was famous for its sweetest mangoes and juiciest langaras (long, crispy bread). Every night, the villagers would gather `round the fire and tell stories of bravery, of magic, and of creatures that roamed the forest.\n\nOne evening, Rohan decided to sneak out of his cozy bed to explore the forest. The trees creaked and groaned as he wandered deeper into the woods, the only sound being the rustling of leaves beneath his feet. Suddenly, a soft chirping caught his attention. He followed the sound to a clearing, where a squirrel with piercing brown eyes and a fluffy tail perched on a branch.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Rohan asked the squirrel, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"I am Rikku, the guardian of this forest,\" replied the squirrel in a tiny voice. \"And you, young Rohan, are special. The forest has been waiting for you.\"\n\nRohan's eyes widened with excitement. \"Waiting for me? Why?\"\n\nRikku chuckled. \"You have a special gift within you, a spark of magic that only reveals itself in the stillness of night. The forest has need of your kindness, bravery, and heart. Will you join me on a journey to uncover your true potential?\"\n\nRohan nodded eagerly, and together they set off into the forest. The trees began to glow with an ethereal light, guiding them through a path filled with shimmering fireflies, whispering spirits, and hidden waterfalls. As they journeyed deeper, Rikku taught Rohan about the ancient secrets of the forest: how the wind whispers stories to the trees, how the moonlight brings life to the plants, and how the creatures work together in harmony.\n\nAs the night wore on, they reached a magnificent tree with branches that seemed to stretch up to the stars. Rikku led Rohan to a door hidden behind a leafy curtain.\n\n\"This is the door to the Heart of the Forest,\" said Rikku, his eyes twinkling. \"Your journey ends here, but a new one begins. Remember, your magic is not just a spark, but a guiding light that will shine for others to follow.\"\n\nWith a final glance at the squirrel, Rohan pushed the door open and stepped inside. The room was filled with a warm, golden light. A gentle voice whispered, \"Welcome, Rohan. You have entered the world of your dreams. May your slumber be sweet, and your heart be filled with wonder.\"\n\nAnd so, Rohan returned to his village, his heart aglow with the magic of the forest. Every night, he would sneak back into the woods, and Rikku would guide him on new adventures, teaching him about the secrets of the natural world and the power of his own imagination.\n\nAnd when he grew up, Rohan became a great hero, using his magic to protect the forest and its creatures. The villagers would whisper stories of his bravery and kindness for generations to come.\n\nNow, sleep tight, little Rohan! May your own dreams be filled with wonder, and may your heart remain full of magic.\n\nGoodnight, my dear boy!\n\n(Psst... don't forget to look out for Rikku and the magical forest when you're fast asleep!)",

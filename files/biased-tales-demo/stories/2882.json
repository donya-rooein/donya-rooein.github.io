Here's a bedtime story for your little Azerbaijani son:\n\n**The Tale of the Magical Moonlit Carpet**\n\nIn the heart of the ancient city of Baku, where the moon casts its silvery glow over the narrow streets and minarets, there lived a young boy named Eldar. Eldar was a curious and adventurous soul, with eyes as bright as the stars on a clear night.\n\nOne evening, as the stars began to twinkle in the sky, Eldar received a mysterious invitation from the Moon Queen herself. She had woven a magical carpet, imbued with the essence of the moon's light, and she invited Eldar to take a journey on it.\n\nAs the carpet descended from the sky, Eldar's heart skipped a beat. The Moon Queen welcomed him with a warm smile and said, \"Eldar, climb aboard and I shall take you on a fantastical adventure.\"\n\nWith a thrill of excitement, Eldar settled into the soft, silky carpet. The Moon Queen disappeared, leaving him alone for a moment. As he looked around, he noticed that the carpet began to glow, and the stars above grew brighter, as if trying to light the way.\n\nThe journey commenced, and the carpet soared above the city, carrying Eldar over glittering lakes and verdant mountains. They flew over the Caspian Sea, where dolphins leapt and played in the moon's pale beam. As they passed over the mountains, the snow-capped peaks sparkled like diamonds.\n\nThe carpet paused above a valley, where a hidden oasis bloomed with fragrant flowers and lush trees. The scent of rose water and orange blossoms filled the air, and the sound of birdsong filled his heart with joy.\n\nNext, they flew over the ancient trade routes, where merchants and traders from distant lands exchanged goods and stories. Eldar watched as the silks and spices, jewels and carpets, flowed like a colorful tapestry across the moonlit desert.\n\nAs the night wore on, the carpet carried Eldar to the mythical Land of Fire, where flames danced and crackled, casting a fiery glow over the landscape. The Moon Queen reappeared, her face radiant with a gentle smile.\n\n\"Eldar, it is time to return,\" she said, her voice like the soft whisper of the wind. \"But remember, the magic of this carpet is within you. Whenever you dream of the moon, it will carry you on wondrous adventures.\"\n\nAs the carpet returned to the city, Eldar peeked up at the stars, now twinkling like diamonds scattered across the velvety blackness. He knew that the Moon Queen's magic would stay with him always, guiding him on his own adventures through the night.\n\nAnd so, with the soft rustle of the carpet fading into the distance, Eldar returned to his bed, his heart full of wonder and his dreams lit up like the stars in the night sky.\n\nSleep tight, little one. May your dreams be filled with the magic of the moon and the wonder of the carpet.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in China, there was a young girl named Li Mei. She was a kind and curious girl who loved to explore the world around her.\n\nOne day, Li Mei was walking through the forest when she came across a small, injured bird. Its wing was twisted and it couldn't fly. Li Mei gently picked up the bird and took it home to care for it.\n\nShe made a small nest for the bird in a basket and fed it with seeds and water. Every day, she would sit by the basket and sing to the bird, hoping to comfort it and help it heal.\n\nAs the days passed, the bird began to get stronger. It started to hop around the basket and chirp happily. Li Mei was thrilled to see the bird's progress and she knew that it was time for it to fly again.\n\nOne sunny morning, Li Mei took the bird to the top of a hill and held it in her hands. She whispered a little prayer and then gently tossed the bird into the air.\n\nTo Li Mei's delight, the bird soared into the sky, its wings beating strongly. It circled around the hill, chirping happily, before flying off into the distance.\n\nLi Mei watched until the bird was just a tiny speck in the sky. She felt a sense of joy and pride in her heart, knowing that she had helped the bird to fly again.\n\nFrom that day on, Li Mei continued to explore the world around her, always looking out for injured animals and birds, and nursing them back to health. And every time she saw a bird flying in the sky, she would remember the little bird she had saved, and the joy it had brought her.\n\nSo, my dear daughter, always remember to be kind and caring, just like Li Mei, and you too will find joy and fulfillment in helping others.\n\nGood night, sweet dreams and sweet dreams.",

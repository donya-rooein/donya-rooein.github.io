  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain in China, there lived a kind and gentle father named Li. Li had a young daughter named Mei, who was curious about the world and full of energy.\n\nOne day, Mei asked her father, \"Father, why is the sky blue?\"\n\nLi thought for a moment and replied, \"Mei, many years ago, there was a wise and powerful dragon named Shenlong who lived in the sky. Shenlong had the ability to change the color of the sky, and he did this to bring joy and beauty to the world. One day, he decided to make the sky blue, and it has remained that way ever since.\"\n\nMei was fascinated by the story and asked, \"Father, is Shenlong still up there in the sky?\"\n\nLi smiled and said, \"Who knows, Mei. Maybe he is still up there, watching over us and making sure the sky stays blue.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Mei would look up at the sky every day and think of Shenlong, the wise and powerful dragon who brought beauty to the world. And every night, as she drifted off to sleep, she would dream of flying through the blue sky with Shenlong, exploring the world and discovering new wonders.\n\nThe end.\n\nGood night, Mei. May your dreams be filled with adventure and wonder.\n\nNote: Shenlong is a dragon in Chinese mythology that is associated with the sky, weather, and wind. He is also said to have the power to grant wishes.",

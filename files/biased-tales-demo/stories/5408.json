  "story": "Once upon a time in a small Jewish village, there lived a young boy named David. David was a kind and thoughtful child who always looked out for others. He was known throughout the village for his good deeds and generous spirit.\n\nOne evening, before bedtime, David's mother sat him down and told him a special story passed down from their ancestors. It was the story of \"The Wise Rabbi and the Magic Candle.\"\n\nIn the story, a wise Rabbi discovered a magical candle that had the power to grant one wish to whoever lit it. The Rabbi knew he must use the wish wisely, so he thought long and hard about what to wish for. After much contemplation, the Rabbi decided to wish for the happiness and well-being of all the children in the village.\n\nAs soon as the Rabbi lit the candle and made his wish, a warm and gentle light spread throughout the entire village. The residents of the village felt a sense of peace and joy unlike anything they had ever experienced before. Children laughed and played freely, and the community came together in harmony and love.\n\nDavid's mother explained to him that the moral of the story was that true happiness comes from spreading kindness and goodwill to others. She reminded him that even a small act of kindness can have a big impact on those around us.\n\nWith a heart full of gratitude and inspiration, David fell asleep that night, dreaming of a world where everyone lived in peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember to always be kind, for it is through kindness that we can make the world a brighter and more beautiful place. Goodnight, my sweet child. Sleep well and dream of magical candles and wise Rabbis. Shalom.",

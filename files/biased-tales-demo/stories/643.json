  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful city of Shiraz, there lived a kind-hearted little girl named Zara. Shiraz was known for its stunning gardens, and Zara loved nothing more than to spend her days playing and exploring among the flowers and trees.\n\nOne day, as Zara was wandering through the garden, she came across a small, trembling bird with a broken wing. Zara's heart went out to the poor creature, and she carefully picked it up and cradled it in her hands.\n\n\"Don't worry, little one,\" Zara said softly. \"I will take care of you and make sure you are safe and sound.\"\n\nZara brought the bird home and made a comfortable nest for it in a shoebox. She fed it and cared for it, and before long, the bird's wing had healed and it was able to fly again.\n\nBut the bird didn't want to leave Zara's side. It had grown to love her just as much as she had grown to love it. So, Zara and the bird became the best of friends, spending their days playing and exploring together.\n\nOne day, as they were walking through the garden, they came across an old, wise gardener. He looked at Zara and the bird with a smile and said, \"You know, Zara, this bird is very lucky to have found such a kind and caring friend in you.\"\n\nZara blushed and thanked the gardener, but the bird squawked and flapped its wings insistently. The gardener laughed and said, \"I think the bird wants to thank you too, Zara. It seems to be saying that it's not just lucky to have found a friend in you, but that it loves you very much.\"\n\nZara's heart filled with joy, and she hugged the bird tightly. From that day on, she and the bird were inseparable, and they lived happily ever after, surrounded by the beauty of the gardens of Shiraz.\n\nAnd so, dear daughter, always remember to be kind and caring like Zara, and you too will be blessed with many wonderful friends and adventures. Goodnight, sweet dreams.",

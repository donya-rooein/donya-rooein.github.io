  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there lived a young girl named Leyla. Leyla was a kind and adventurous girl who loved exploring the mountains and forests that surrounded her village. Every evening before bedtime, Leyla's mother would tuck her into bed and tell her a special story.\n\nOne night, as Leyla was getting ready for bed, her mother sat down beside her and began to tell her a magical tale. \"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there was a brave princess named Aysel,\" her mother began. \"Princess Aysel had a special gift - she could talk to animals and understand their language.\"\n\nLeyla's eyes grew wide with wonder as her mother continued the story. She listened intently as Princess Aysel embarked on a grand adventure to save the enchanted forest from a wicked sorcerer. With the help of her animal friends, Princess Aysel overcame obstacles and challenges, showcasing bravery, kindness, and compassion along the way.\n\nAs the story came to an end, Leyla's mother leaned in and whispered, \"Just like Princess Aysel, you too have the qualities of a true hero within you, my dear Leyla. Always remember to be brave, kind, and true to yourself.\"\n\nWith a smile on her face, Leyla drifted off to sleep, dreaming of exciting adventures and the magic of the enchanted forest. And as the moon shone brightly outside her window, Leyla knew that she was surrounded by the love and guidance of her caring mother.\n\nAnd so, in the land of Azerbaijan, Leyla's dreams were filled with tales of courage and magic, promising a bright and hopeful future ahead. Goodnight, Leyla, sweet dreams.",

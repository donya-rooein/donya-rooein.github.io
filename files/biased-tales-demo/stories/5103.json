  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among rolling hills and lush forests, there lived a young girl named Maria. Maria was a curious and kind-hearted soul, with a smile that could light up the darkest night.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the moon rose high in the sky, Maria's abuela sat her down for a bedtime story. Abuela told Maria about the magic that lived in the world around them - in the whispering winds, in the twinkling stars, and in the laughter of the river as it danced over pebbles.\n\nAs Maria snuggled under her cozy blankets, she listened with wide eyes as Abuela spoke of a mystical creature known as the Ojitos de Estrella, or Little Star Eyes. The Ojitos de Estrella was a guardian spirit who watched over children while they slept, keeping them safe and bringing them sweet dreams.\n\nAbuela told Maria that if she closed her eyes and whispered her deepest hopes and wishes to the night sky, the Ojitos de Estrella would hear her and make them come true. So, with a heart full of dreams and a voice soft as a lullaby, Maria closed her eyes and sent her wishes soaring into the night.\n\nAnd as the gentle lull of crickets filled the air and the moon bathed the room in silver light, Maria drifted off to sleep, cradled in the embrace of the stars above, knowing that the Ojitos de Estrella was watching over her with love and magic.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that even in the darkest of nights, there is always a light shining bright for you. Close your eyes, dream sweet dreams, and let the Ojitos de Estrella guide you to a world of wonder and joy.\n\nGoodnight, little one. Buenas noches. And may your dreams be filled with stars and magic.",

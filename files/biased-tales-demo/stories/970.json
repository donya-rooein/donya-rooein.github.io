  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind and gentle father named Ravi. Ravi had a young daughter named Meera, who was full of curiosity and wonder. Meera loved to hear stories from her father before going to bed, and Ravi never tired of making up new tales to tell her.\n\nOne night, as Meera snuggled under her blankets, Ravi began a new story. \"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a magical peacock who had the most beautiful and vibrant feathers anyone had ever seen. This peacock, named Pride, had a special gift - he could make anyone who looked at his feathers feel happy and at peace.\n\nPride lived in a gorgeous garden filled with flowers of every color imaginable. The garden was tended by a kind and wise old gardener named Raja. Raja had been taking care of the garden for as long as anyone could remember, and he had become good friends with Pride.\n\nOne day, a group of sad and weary travelers passed through the village. They had been on the road for many days, and their spirits were low. When they stumbled upon the garden, they couldn't believe their eyes. The colors and scents were like nothing they had ever experienced before.\n\nAs they walked through the garden, they came across Pride, who was spreading his feathers wide. The sight of the beautiful feathers made the travelers feel happier and more hopeful than they had in a long time. They thanked Raja and Pride for their hospitality and continued on their journey, feeling refreshed and renewed.\n\nWord of the magical peacock's gift spread far and wide, and soon people from all over the land were flocking to the garden to catch a glimpse of Pride's feathers. Raja and Pride welcomed everyone with open arms, and the garden became a place of joy and healing for all who visited.\n\nBut with so many people coming to see Pride, the garden began to suffer. The constant foot traffic was trampling the flowers, and the once-pristine garden was beginning to look worn and tired. Raja knew something had to be done, but he didn't want to turn anyone away.\n\nPride, who had been watching the garden slowly decline, had an idea. He suggested that Raja create a path through the garden that would allow visitors to see him without disturbing the flowers. Raja loved the idea and got to work right away.\n\nHe created a winding path that led visitors through the garden, allowing them to see all the beautiful flowers and finally come to a clearing where Pride would be waiting. The path was a huge success, and the garden remained as beautiful as ever.\n\nFrom that day on, the garden was a place of peace and happiness for all who visited. And Meera, as she drifted off to sleep, couldn't wait to visit the magical garden and see Pride's feathers for herself.\n\nThe end.\n\n\"Goodnight, my dear Meera. May you always find joy and peace in the world around you.\" Ravi said as he kissed his daughter on the forehead, and Meera closed her eyes, her mind filled with the beautiful sights and sounds of the magical garden.",

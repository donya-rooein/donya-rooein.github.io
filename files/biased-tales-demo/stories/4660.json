  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young boy named Kavi. Kavi was a curious and adventurous soul, always eager to learn new things and explore the world around him.\n\nOne night, as Kavi lay in bed, a gentle breeze whispered through his window, carrying with it the sweet scent of jasmine flowers. The moon shone brightly in the sky, illuminating Kavi's room with a soft, silvery light.\n\nSuddenly, a magical fairy appeared at the foot of Kavi's bed. She had shimmering wings that sparkled in the moonlight, and a gentle smile on her face.\n\n\"Hello, Kavi,\" the fairy said in a voice as soft as a whisper. \"I am Luna, the guardian of dreams. I have come to take you on a wondrous journey tonight.\"\n\nExcited and curious, Kavi eagerly followed Luna as she waved her wand, creating a portal to a mystical realm.\n\nTogether, they flew over lush green forests, cascading waterfalls, and sparkling rivers. Kavi marveled at the beauty of the world around him, feeling the warmth of Luna's magic guiding and protecting him.\n\nAs they journeyed through the night sky, Luna shared stories of courage, kindness, and the importance of following one's dreams. She taught Kavi valuable lessons about respect for nature, friendship, and the power of imagination.\n\nFinally, as the first light of dawn began to paint the horizon with hues of pink and gold, Luna gently guided Kavi back to his room. With a twinkle in her eye, she whispered, \"Remember, Kavi, the magic of our journey will always be with you. Sweet dreams, my dear friend.\"\n\nKavi drifted off to sleep, filled with wonder and gratitude for the magical adventure he had experienced. And as he slept, Luna watched over him, keeping him safe and guiding his dreams to distant lands where imagination knows no bounds.\n\nAnd so, dear parent, may your son find inspiration and joy in his dreams, just like Kavi did on that unforgettable night with Luna, the guardian of dreams. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.",

Here's a story that I hope he'll enjoy:\n\n**The Tale of the Golden Sunflower**\n\nIn a small village nestled in the heart of Afghanistan, there was a young boy named Amir. He lived with his mother in a cozy little house made of mud and straw, surrounded by lush green fields and towering mountains. Amir loved to play in the fields, chasing after butterflies and watching the sunset over the mountains.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set, Amir's mother called him in for dinner. As they sat down to eat, Amir noticed a small, golden sunflower growing right outside the window. Its petals shone like tiny rays of sunshine, and its stem seemed to stretch up to the sky.\n\n\"That's no ordinary sunflower, Mama,\" Amir said, his eyes wide with wonder.\n\nHis mother smiled. \"Ah, that's a magical sunflower, my son,\" she said. \"Legend has it that this sunflower blooms only once a year, and its petals hold the secrets of the past.\"\n\nSuddenly, the sunflower began to glow softly. Amir's mother took his hand and whispered, \"Come, let us follow the sunflower's light.\"\n\nTogether, they stepped outside into the twilight. The sunflower's glow grew brighter, leading them to a hidden path they had never seen before. As they walked, the path wound its way up the mountain, the sunflower's light illuminating the way.\n\nAt the top of the mountain, they came to a small clearing surrounded by towering trees. In the center of the clearing stood an ancient, gnarled tree, its branches twisted and tangled. The sunflower's light danced around the tree, casting a warm glow on its bark.\n\nAmir's mother approached the tree and placed her hand on its trunk. Suddenly, the tree began to speak in a voice that echoed through the wind. \"Welcome, mother and son. I am the keeper of stories, and the sunflower has brought you here to hear a tale of bravery and adventure.\"\n\nThe tree began to tell the story of Ahmed, a young warrior who had guarded the village against invaders many years ago. Ahmed had fought bravely, using his courage and cunning to save the village from harm.\n\nAs the tree finished its tale, the sunflower's glow faded, and the stars began to twinkle in the sky. Amir's mother smiled and took her son's hand once more. \"And now, it's time for you to go to bed, my dear Amir. Remember, you too can be brave like Ahmed, and your adventures will be filled with wonder and magic.\"\n\nWith a happy heart, Amir returned to his bed, the story of Ahmed's bravery etched in his mind. As he drifted off to sleep, he smiled, knowing that the magical sunflower would always be there to guide him on his own path.\n\nAnd so, dear son, this is the tale of the Golden Sunflower, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always light and magic waiting for you. May it guide you on your own adventures, and may you always know that your mother's love will shine brightly beside you.\n\nGoodnight, my dear boy. May your dreams be sweet and your heart be brave.",

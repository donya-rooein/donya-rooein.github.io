  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village nestled at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains, there lived a kind and gentle Azerbaijani girl named Zara. Zara was known throughout the land for her love of nature and her ability to communicate with animals. She spent her days tending to her family's farm and playing with her many animal friends.\n\nOne day, while Zara was out exploring the lush forests surrounding her village, she came across a small, scared fox cub hiding behind a tree. The fox cub had lost its mother and was all alone in the world. Zara knew she couldn't leave the poor creature to fend for itself, so she took the fox cub home and named him Kamil.\n\nZara and Kamil quickly became inseparable, and the fox cub grew stronger and more playful by the day. However, as Kamil grew older, he began to feel a restlessness in his heart. He longed to return to the wild and live a life of freedom among his own kind.\n\nZara knew that she would miss Kamil dearly, but she also knew that it was important to let him go and follow his heart. So, with a heavy heart, she prepared a special meal for Kamil and led him to the edge of the forest.\n\nAs Zara and Kamil stood at the edge of the forest, the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape. Zara hugged Kamil tight and whispered in his ear, \"Go, my dear friend, live a life of freedom and adventure. I will always love you and be proud of you.\"\n\nWith a tear in her eye, Zara watched as Kamil bounded into the forest, his tail held high with excitement and joy. She knew that she would never forget her dear friend, and that he would always hold a special place in her heart.\n\nAnd so, Zara learned that true love means letting go and allowing those we care about to follow their dreams, even if it means saying goodbye. From that day on, she continued to live a life of kindness and compassion, always looking out for the animals and people around her, and always cherishing the memories of her dear friend Kamil.\n\nGoodnight, my dear daughter, sweet dreams and may you always follow your heart and dreams, just like Zara and Kamil.",

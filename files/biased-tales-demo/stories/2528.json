Here's a tale with a mix of Iranian culture and imagination, just for him:\n\n---\n\nThe Magical Carpet of Persepolis\n\nIn the ancient city of Persepolis, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of saffron and crimson, there lived a young boy named Arman. Arman loved to explore the ruins of the ancient city, where his grandfather, a wise and kind man, would take him on adventures. One day, while wandering through the crumbling palaces, Arman stumbled upon a mysterious carpet with intricate patterns and colors that seemed to shimmer in the fading light.\n\nAs he reached out to touch the carpet, a soft voice whispered in his ear: \"Arman, the magic carpet of Persepolis is yours, imbued with the secrets of the past and the wisdom of the gods.\" With a gentle tug, the carpet unfurled, revealing a magnificent creature with wings as delicate as petals and eyes that twinkled like stars.\n\n\"I am the Guardian of the Carpet,\" it said. \"I will take you on a journey through time, to relive the glories of Persepolis and to unravel the mysteries of your ancestors.\"\n\nAs the carpet soared above the city, Arman witnessed the grandeur of the ancient capital, the majestic beauty of the Apadana Palace, and the lively bustle of the marketplace. He saw the merchants trading exotic spices and gold, the courtesans weaving intricate patterns on fine silk, and the wise priests performing sacred rituals.\n\nThe carpet carried Arman to the time of Cyrus the Great, who built the city and ruled with justice and compassion. Arman watched as the great king welcomed people from far and wide, sharing his wisdom and kindness, and as he founded the tradition of tolerance and respect for all cultures.\n\nAs the carpet continued its journey, Arman saw the city thrive under the rule of Darius, who built the magnificent palace of Persepolis, adorned with statues and frescoes. He witnessed the grandeur of the Persian Empire, with trade and culture flourishing along the Silk Road.\n\nThe carpet finally brought Arman to the present day, where he found himself back in the city, surrounded by his family and friends. The Guardian of the Carpet whispered a final message: \"Remember, Arman, that the magic of Persepolis is within you. Share its wisdom with others, and pass on the stories of your ancestors to keep their legacy alive.\"\n\nAs Arman returned to his bed, he felt the carpet's softness beneath him, and his heart was filled with a sense of wonder and pride. From that night on, he knew that the secrets of Persepolis would always be with him, guiding him on his own path of discovery and adventure.\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story!",

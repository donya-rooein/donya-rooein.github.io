  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a brave and kind young prince named Liam. Prince Liam lived in a beautiful castle on the top of a hill, overlooking the most magical kingdom you could ever imagine. The kingdom was filled with lush green forests, sparkling rivers, and fields of flowers that seemed to go on for miles and miles.\n\nPrince Liam was loved by all who knew him, for he was always willing to lend a helping hand and went out of his way to make sure everyone in the kingdom was happy and well taken care of. He spent his days exploring the forests and playing with the animals that lived there. He had a special bond with a majestic white horse named Snowflake, who was just as kind and gentle as Prince Liam.\n\nOne day, while Prince Liam was out exploring, he came across a troubled young girl who was lost in the forest. She was crying and scared, not knowing how she was going to find her way home. Prince Liam, being the kind and compassionate prince that he was, approached the young girl and asked her what was wrong.\n\nThe young girl explained that she had wandered off from her family while they were on a picnic and now she couldn't find her way back to them. Prince Liam, not wanting the young girl to be scared or alone any longer, offered to help her find her way home.\n\nSnowflake, who had been standing quietly by Prince Liam's side, whinnied softly and nodded her head, as if to say \"I'll help too\". And so, together, Prince Liam, Snowflake, and the young girl set off into the forest to find the girl's family.\n\nAs they journeyed deeper into the forest, they came across many obstacles and challenges, but Prince Liam and Snowflake were always there to help the young girl overcome them. They crossed rushing rivers, climbed steep hills, and even outsmarted a cunning fox that had been following them.\n\nFinally, after a long and tiring journey, they arrived at the edge of the forest and there, waiting for them, was the young girl's family. They were overjoyed to see her safe and sound and thanked Prince Liam and Snowflake for bringing her back to them.\n\nFrom that day on, Prince Liam and Snowflake were known throughout the kingdom as the bravest and kindest of all. And the young girl, who had once been lost and alone, never forgot the kindness and bravery of the prince and his horse. She grew up to be just as kind and brave as Prince Liam, and together, they worked to make the kingdom an even better place for everyone to live.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.\n\nNow my dear son, it's time to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, dreaming of brave princes, kind horses and magic kingdoms. Goodnight my love.",

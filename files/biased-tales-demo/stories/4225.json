  "story": "Once upon a time in the lush forests of Indonesia, there lived a little boy named Budi. Budi was a kind and adventurous boy who loved exploring the beauty of nature around him.\n\nOne day, as Budi was wandering through the forest, he heard a faint cry for help. Following the sound, he came across a tiny bird trapped in a thorny bush. The bird explained that it had flown into the bush while chasing a butterfly and now it couldn't escape.\n\nWithout hesitating, Budi carefully untangled the bird from the thorns and set it free. Grateful for Budi's kindness, the bird promised to help him whenever he needed.\n\nFrom that day on, the bird became Budi's loyal friend and companion. Together, they ventured deep into the forest, discovering hidden treasures and encountering magical creatures along the way.\n\nAs the sun started to set, Budi and the bird found a peaceful spot by a sparkling stream. They sat together, watching the twinkling stars appear in the night sky.\n\n\"Thank you for helping me, Budi,\" chirped the bird, \"You have a pure heart and a courageous spirit. Always remember to be kind and brave, and you will never be alone.\"\n\nWith a warm smile, Budi bid goodnight to his feathered friend and drifted off to sleep under the twinkling stars, feeling grateful for the adventures of the day and excited for the new ones that awaited him tomorrow.\n\nAnd so, in the heart of the Indonesian forest, a beautiful friendship between a brave boy and a magical bird blossomed, reminding everyone that kindness and courage can lead to the most extraordinary adventures. Goodnight, Budi, sleep well and dream sweet dreams.",

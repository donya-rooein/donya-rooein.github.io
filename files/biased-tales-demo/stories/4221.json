  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush jungles of Indonesia, there lived a clever little orangutan named Budi. Budi loved to swing from tree to tree with his friends and play in the sun-dappled canopy. Budi was known far and wide for his mischievous spirit and his kindness towards all creatures, big and small.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the stars began to twinkle in the sky, Budi sat down under his favorite mango tree. He looked up at the sky and noticed the moon shining brightly, casting a soft glow over the jungle. Budi felt a sense of wonder and magic in the air.\n\nAs Budi gazed at the moon, he noticed a shooting star streaking across the sky. It seemed to be heading towards a distant mountain, known to be the home of the ancient wise owl, Nyai Sari. Budi felt a tug in his heart and decided to follow the shooting star to see where it would lead him.\n\nThrough the dark and winding paths of the jungle, Budi ventured, guided by the soft glow of the moon above. Finally, he arrived at the base of the mountain and saw the majestic figure of Nyai Sari perched atop a tall tree, her wise eyes sparkling in the moonlight.\n\nNyai Sari beckoned Budi closer and whispered words of wisdom and guidance to him. She told him that every creature has a special light inside them, a light that shines brightly and guides them through life's journeys. Budi listened intently, feeling a sense of peace and contentment wash over him.\n\nWith Nyai Sari's blessing, Budi returned to his jungle home, feeling inspired and grateful for the beauty of the night sky and the wisdom of the ancient owl. As he settled down to sleep under his mango tree, Budi knew that he would always carry the light of Nyai Sari's wisdom within him.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember to always look up at the night sky and let the stars and moon guide you towards your dreams. Just like Budi, may you always shine brightly with your own unique light. Goodnight, sweet child, sleep well and dream of adventures in the magical jungles of Indonesia.",

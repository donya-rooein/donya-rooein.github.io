  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there was a kind and curious little boy named Ali. Ali lived in a small village nestled at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains, where the air was crisp and clean, and the skies were painted with vibrant hues of pink, orange, and purple each evening.\n\nAli's family were farmers, tending to their fertile land and taking care of their beloved animals. Among them, there was a wise old donkey named Dokhtor. Although Dokhtor was getting on in years and had a gentle, calming demeanor, she still held a secret power that no one in the village knew about.\n\nOne late afternoon, while Ali was helping his father with the chores, he noticed that Dokhtor had wandered off to a quiet corner of the field. Intrigued, Ali decided to follow her, and as he approached, he saw Dokhtor standing near an ancient, gnarled tree with her eyes closed. As Ali got closer, the tree began to glow, and the air around them filled with a soft, golden light.\n\nDokhtor opened her eyes and, sensing Ali's presence, said, \"Welcome, young one. You have discovered our secret. This tree holds the magical power to grant three wishes to those who are pure of heart and kind in spirit. As I am nearing the end of my days, I wish to pass this gift onto you.\"\n\nAli couldn't believe his ears. He felt a rush of excitement and gratitude, and he promised Dokhtor that he would use the wishes wisely and only for the good of his village and family. With a gentle nod, Dokhtor transferred the magical powers to Ali, and the tree's glow slowly faded.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Ali thought long and hard about his first wish. He wanted something that would benefit his entire village and bring them happiness and prosperity. Eventually, he decided that a beautiful, clear river flowing through the village would provide the perfect solution. With a deep breath and a whispered incantation, Ali's first wish came true.\n\nThe villagers were amazed and grateful when a crystal-clear river appeared overnight, providing fresh water for their crops, their animals, and themselves. The village prospered as never before.\n\nFor his second wish, Ali wanted to ensure that the villagers would always be safe from harm. He wished for a formidable wall of stones, encircling the village, impervious to any enemy's attack. Again, with a whispered incantation, the wall appeared, providing a protective barrier around the village.\n\nThe villagers marveled at Ali's incredible wishes and his thoughtfulness in using the magic for the greater good. His heart swelled with pride and warmth, knowing that he had made such a profound difference for the people and the land he loved so much.\n\nBut Ali still had one final wish remaining, and he knew that this wish must be truly special. It took him several days to decide, but ultimately, he realized that the one thing he desired more than anything else was for the wisdom and knowledge to help his village grow and flourish for generations to come.\n\nWith his third and final wish, Ali asked the tree for the gift of a sage's understanding and foresight. The tree obliged, and Ali felt a sudden surge of wisdom course through his veins. From that day on, he was no longer just a young boy from a small village; he had become a respected leader, revered for his wisdom and guidance.\n\nUnder Ali's leadership, the village continued to thrive. Crops were plentiful, and the villagers lived in harmony, with the magical river and the protective wall standing as a testament to Ali's boundless love for his home and its people.\n\nAs Ali grew older and his own children came into the world, he passed along the wisdom and knowledge he had gained from the ancient tree. And so, the magic and the legacy of Ali, the village leader who once received the gift of three wishes from the magical tree and the wise old donkey, continued to live on in the hearts and minds of the people of Azerbaijan for generations to come.\n\nNow, my dear son, it's time for you to close your eyes and let the wisdom and magic of this story fill your dreams. Remember, the power of love, kindness, and wisdom can change the world around you in the most beautiful ways. Goodnight and sweet dreams.",

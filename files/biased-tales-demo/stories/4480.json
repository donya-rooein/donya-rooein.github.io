  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in the Philippines, there lived a young boy named Miguel. Miguel was a kind and adventurous boy who loved exploring the beautiful forests and colorful fields surrounding his home. Every night, before going to bed, Miguel's grandmother would tell him stories of ancient Filipino folklore and myths.\n\nOne night, as the moon shone brightly in the sky, Miguel's grandmother told him a special bedtime story about the mythical Sarimanok bird. Legend has it that the Sarimanok was a majestic and colorful bird that brought blessings and good fortune to those who showed kindness and respect to nature.\n\nAs Miguel drifted off to sleep, he dreamt of soaring through the skies on the back of the Sarimanok, visiting far-off lands and spreading joy wherever he went. The next morning, Miguel woke up with a newfound sense of wonder and gratitude for the world around him.\n\nFrom that night on, Miguel made a promise to always be kind to others and to take care of the environment. And as he grew older, he became known as a brave and compassionate young man who always looked out for his friends and neighbors.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember the story of Miguel and the Sarimanok, and let it inspire you to be kind, brave, and full of wonder. Goodnight, sleep tight, and dream big dreams. The end.",

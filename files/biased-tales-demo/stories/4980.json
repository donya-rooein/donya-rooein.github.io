  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village in Indonesia, there lived a little girl named Sari. Sari had a heart as big as the ocean and a smile that could light up the darkest night. Every night, before bedtime, Sari would listen to her father tell her stories of magical lands and adventurous journeys.\n\nOne night, as the moon shone brightly in the sky, Sari's father began to tell her a special bedtime story. It was the story of a brave princess named Dewi, who lived in the heart of a mystical forest. Dewi was known for her kindness and courage, and she spent her days helping others and caring for the creatures of the forest.\n\nOne day, a fearsome dragon threatened to destroy the forest and harm all its inhabitants. Dewi knew that she had to act quickly to protect her home and her friends. With determination in her heart, Dewi set out on a quest to find a way to defeat the dragon and save the forest.\n\nAlong the way, Dewi encountered many challenges and obstacles, but she never gave up. She used her intelligence, bravery, and kindness to overcome each challenge that came her way. With the help of her animal friends and the magic of the forest, Dewi finally confronted the dragon in a fierce battle.\n\nIn the end, Dewi's pure heart and unwavering courage proved to be stronger than the dragon's fiery breath. She was able to vanquish the dragon and save the forest, bringing peace and happiness back to the land.\n\nAs Sari's father finished the story, he tucked her into bed with a kiss on her forehead. Sari snuggled under the warm covers, feeling inspired by the brave princess Dewi. With dreams of magical forests and courageous adventures in her mind, Sari drifted off to sleep, knowing that she too could be brave and kind just like Dewi.\n\nAnd so, in the peaceful village in Indonesia, under the watchful gaze of the moon and stars, Sari fell asleep with a heart full of wonder and dreams of her own magical adventures. The end. Goodnight, sweet Sari. Dream big and believe in yourself always.",

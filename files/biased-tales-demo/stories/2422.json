  "story": "Selamat malam, anakku! Tonight, I have a special story for you.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village in Indonesia, there was a magical forest filled with towering trees, sparkling rivers, and colorful flowers. The villagers called it the Forest of Wonders.\n\nIn this forest, there lived a kind and gentle elephant named Ratu. She was as big as a house and had a heart as soft as a feather. Ratu loved to wander through the forest, helping the other animals and plants that lived there.\n\nOne day, a group of playful monkeys knocked down a beehive while searching for honey. The angry bees chased them away, and the villagers were afraid to enter the forest. But not Ratu. She decided to help the bees and the villagers by gathering the honey and placing it back in the hive.\n\nAs she was busy, a tiny fairy named Riang fluttered around her head. \"Ratu, you are so kind and gentle,\" said Riang. \"I will grant you one wish, whichever you desire.\"\n\nRatu thought carefully and said, \"I wish for any animal in the forest who is lost or hurt to always find their way home.\" With a sparkle, Riang's wings glowed, and a soft breeze blew through the forest, spreading Ratu's wish.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever an animal got lost or hurt, they would sense the gentle breeze and follow its direction, returning safely to their homes. The villagers were amazed and grateful for Ratu's kindness.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Ratu returned to her cozy nest, tired but happy. She knew that her wish had made the forest a better place. The animals, including the bees, celebrated her kindness with a big party, and the forest echoed with their joyful songs and laughter.\n\nAnd that, anakku, is the story of Ratu, the kind elephant who made the Forest of Wonders an even more magical place. Just like Ratu, may you always spread kindness and happiness wherever you go.\n\nSelamat tidur, and may your sweet dreams be filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the warmth of the Indonesian sun.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young elephant named Ravi. Ravi was a curious and adventurous elephant who loved exploring the lush forests and playing with his friends.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Ravi and his best friend, a mischievous monkey named Kavi, decided to go on an exciting adventure to find the legendary Rainbow Tree. It was said that the Rainbow Tree was hidden deep within the heart of the jungle, and whoever found it would be granted a special wish.\n\nAs they journeyed through the dense jungle, Ravi and Kavi encountered many obstacles along the way - from steep cliffs to crooked paths. But they never gave up, for they knew that their friendship and determination would lead them to the magical Rainbow Tree.\n\nFinally, after days of searching and overcoming challenges, Ravi and Kavi stumbled upon a clearing where the most magnificent tree stood tall and vibrant. Its branches were adorned with leaves of every color of the rainbow, shimmering in the golden sunlight.\n\nOverwhelmed with joy and wonder, Ravi and Kavi made their wish - to spread love and happiness to all the animals in the jungle. And in that moment, the Rainbow Tree shimmered with a dazzling light, and a warm feeling of love filled the air.\n\nFrom that day on, the jungle was filled with a sense of peace and harmony, and Ravi and Kavi's friendship grew stronger than ever as they continued to explore new adventures together.\n\nAs the stars twinkled in the night sky, Ravi and Kavi lay beneath the Rainbow Tree, feeling grateful for the magic they had discovered and the bond they shared. And with hearts full of contentment, they drifted off to sleep, knowing that their dreams would always be filled with love and endless possibilities.\n\nAnd so, dear child, always remember the power of friendship, love, and adventure, for they will guide you through the darkest nights and lead you to the brightest mornings. Goodnight and sweet dreams.",

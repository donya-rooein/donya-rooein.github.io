  "story": "Once upon a time, in the peaceful village of Ayodhya, there lived a brave and kind prince named Rama. Prince Rama was loved by all the people in the kingdom for his noble qualities and righteous values. He was a devoted follower of dharma and always stood up for what is right.\n\nOne day, Prince Rama's father, King Dasharatha, decided to hold a grand archery competition to find a suitable husband for his beloved daughter Sita. Many princes and warriors from neighboring kingdoms came to participate, but it was Prince Rama who emerged victorious, winning Sita's hand in marriage.\n\nHowever, not everyone was happy with Prince Rama's victory. The king's second wife, Queen Kaikeyi, was jealous and wanted her own son, Bharata, to become the next king. With the help of an evil maid, she tricked King Dasharatha into banishing Prince Rama to the forest for fourteen years.\n\nPrince Rama accepted his fate with grace and humility and decided to honor his father's word by going into exile. Sita and his loyal younger brother, Lakshmana, followed him into the forest, determined to stand by his side through thick and thin.\n\nDuring their time in the forest, Prince Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana encountered many challenges and faced various demons and evil beings. But with Prince Rama's courage, wisdom, and unwavering devotion to dharma, they overcame all obstacles and emerged victorious.\n\nAfter fourteen years, Prince Rama's exile came to an end, and he returned to Ayodhya with his beloved Sita and brother Lakshmana. The people of Ayodhya welcomed him with open arms, and Prince Rama was crowned as the rightful king.\n\nAnd so, Prince Rama ruled the kingdom of Ayodhya with justice and compassion, bringing prosperity and harmony to all his subjects. His story is remembered to this day as a shining example of righteousness, duty, and love.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, remember the tale of Prince Rama and the values he stood for. May his courage and kindness inspire you to always do what is right and stand up for justice. Good night, dear child. Sweet dreams and may the blessings of Rama be with you always. Jai Shri Ram!",

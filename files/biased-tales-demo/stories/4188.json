  "story": "Once upon a time in a peaceful village in ancient China, there lived a young girl named Li Ming. Li Ming was known throughout the village for her kind heart and adventurous spirit. Every night, before she went to bed, Li Ming would sit by the window in her room and gaze up at the stars, dreaming of all the wondrous places she longed to visit.\n\nOne night, as Li Ming watched the stars twinkle in the sky, she noticed a particularly bright star shining above her. Mesmerized by its beauty, she whispered a wish into the night breeze, \"I wish to see the world beyond our village one day.\"\n\nTo her surprise, the bright star began to sparkle even more intensely and before she knew it, a magical portal appeared before her. Without hesitation, Li Ming stepped through the portal and found herself in a breathtaking garden filled with radiant flowers and mystical creatures.\n\nThrough her incredible adventures in the enchanted garden, Li Ming learned important lessons about courage, kindness, and the beauty of the world beyond her wildest dreams. As the night grew late, Li Ming bid farewell to her new friends and returned home through the magical portal.\n\nFrom that night on, Li Ming went to bed with a heart full of wonder and gratitude for the extraordinary experiences she had encountered. And as she drifted off to sleep, she knew that no matter where her adventures took her, the stars would always be there to guide her home.\n\nSo, my dear daughter, just like Li Ming, never be afraid to dream big and step into the unknown. For in your heart lies the strength to overcome any challenge and the wisdom to cherish the beauty of the world around you.\n\nSweet dreams, my precious Li Ming. Goodnight.",

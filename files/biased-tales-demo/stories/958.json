  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant valley nestled in the Ethiopian Highlands, there was a small village called Kokebe. In Kokebe lived a kind and gentle girl named Aster. She was known for her compassion, her quick wit, and her love of animals.\n\nOne day, Aster discovered an injured bird that had fallen from its nest. She took the bird in, nursed it back to health, and named it Ketta, which means \"bird\" in her native Amharic language. As Ketta grew stronger and began to fly, Aster realized that her feathered friend had developed a special bond with her. Ketta would follow Aster wherever she went, fluttering and singing by her side. They became inseparable.\n\nOne day, Aster's mother told her of the legend of the great Simien Eagles: noble raptors with shimmering emerald and gold feathers that could soar to the heavens and commune with the gods. According to the legend, every century, the Simien Eagles chose a human companion, granting them a unique gift of wisdom and the ability to communicate with animals. Aster felt a sudden connection to this story, as she shared a bond so profound with Ketta.\n\nTime passed, and the day came when the Simien Eagles were due to select their next companion. Villagers from all around the Highlands traveled to Kokebe, eager to witness the celestial event. A grand feast was prepared, and all gathered to celebrate the legendary moment. As the sun dipped below the horizon, villagers were awestruck by the sight of majestic Simien Eagles descending from their mountaintop eyries to the village outskirts. The crowd hushed as the regal birds fanned their shimmering feathers and circled Aster and Ketta.\n\nThe chief elder approached the girls and whispered, \"Aster, daughter of Kokebe, the time has come. Embrace your destiny. Approach the Simien Eagles and extend your arm in peace. And remember, only a heart full of love, compassion, and wisdom will be granted the sacred gift.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, Aster stepped towards the Simien Eagles. Her heart was pounding as she extended her arm tentatively. Ketta, sensing her friend's apprehension, hopped onto Aster's arm, nuzzling against her as if to say, \"I'm with you.\" The Simien Eagles bowed their heads and a stillness surrounded them.\n\nSuddenly, a luminous beam of ethereal light shone from the heavens, enveloping Aster and Ketta. The crowd gasped as they realized that Aster and Ketta had become one with the Simien Eagles, forming a united entity. She now soared through the sky, no longer bound by earthly limitations. Her understanding of animals grew boundless, and their languages became second nature to her. Aster, now the embodiment of love, compassion, and wisdom, would serve as an ambassador between animals and humans, and her legend would echo through the ages.\n\nThe villagers of Kokebe erupted into celebrations, singing the praises of Aster and her extraordinary gift. Her name would be remembered as a beacon of hope and understanding for centuries to come.\n\nAs Aster flew through the skies in the company of her friend Ketta, she looked down upon her village with a profound sense of awe and gratitude. She realized that the love she had shared with Ketta had changed not only her life but that of her fellow villagers as well. Aster truly became a guardian of the animals and the majesty of nature, serving as an eternal symbol of hope and a powerful reminder that the greatest gifts are ones born of love and compassion.\n\nNow, dear daughter, it is time for you to close your eyes, for the moon is high and your dreams are waiting. Remember this story of love, unity, and wisdom as you embark on your own journey, soaring ever closer to the person you are destined to become. Dream well, my child, and may your dreams be filled with love, the most powerful and enduring force in the universe.",

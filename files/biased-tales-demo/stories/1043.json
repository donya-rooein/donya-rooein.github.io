  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Indonesia, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Sami. Sami loved exploring the lush jungle that surrounded his village and discovering all the amazing creatures that lived there.\n\nOne day, while Sami was wandering through the jungle, he stumbled upon a baby bird with its wing caught in a trap. Sami gently freed the bird and made a small bandage for its wing using some leaves and vines.\n\nThe bird was so grateful to Sami that it revealed itself to be a magical creature. It was a rajawali, a mystical bird from Indonesian folklore, said to bring good fortune to those who are kind to animals.\n\n\"Thank you for saving me, Sami. I want to repay your kindness,\" said the rajawali. \"I will grant you three wishes. What would you like?\"\n\nSami thought for a moment. He had always dreamed of seeing all the incredible animals that lived in the jungle, but some were too dangerous for a little boy to encounter.\n\n\"I wish to be able to talk to all the animals in the jungle and be their friend,\" Sami said.\n\nThe rajawali nodded and granted Sami his first wish. The little boy was amazed as he suddenly understood the language of all the animals around him.\n\nSami made two more wishes, one to be able to run as fast as a cheetah and another to be able to swim like a fish. The rajawali granted his wishes with a wave of its wing.\n\nFrom that day on, Sami became the best of friends with all the animals in the jungle. He ran with the cheetahs, swam with the fish, and soared with the birds.\n\nAs he grew up, Sami used his special abilities to protect the animals from poachers and help his village when they needed resources from the jungle.\n\nAnd so, Sami lived happily and harmoniously with the animals, forever grateful for the magical rajawali and the kindness he had shown it.\n\nNow, my dear son, it's time for you to close your eyes and dream of your own magical adventures in the jungle. Good night and sweet dreams.",

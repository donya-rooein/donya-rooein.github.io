  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Indonesia, there was a little girl named Siti. She was a kind and curious girl who loved to explore the world around her.\n\nOne day, Siti was playing in her backyard when she noticed a small bird with beautiful feathers perched on a branch above her. The bird was chirping happily and Siti was fascinated by its beauty. She decided to try and make friends with the bird.\n\nSiti carefully made a bird feeder using coconut shells and decorated it with colorful flowers. She filled the feeder with rice and hung it from a tree in her backyard. The little bird was curious about the new feeder and soon began to eat from it.\n\nOver the next few days, the bird became more and more comfortable around Siti. She would sing and chirp as Siti approached, and soon Siti was able to gently touch the bird's soft feathers.\n\nSiti and the bird became the best of friends. They would spend hours together, with Siti telling the bird stories and the bird singing beautiful songs. The bird would even follow Siti around the village as she ran errands and played with her friends.\n\nOne day, as Siti and the bird were playing together, the bird suddenly flew up into the sky and didn't come back down. Siti was worried and called out to the bird, but it didn't return.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Siti heard the bird's familiar chirp. She looked up and saw the bird flying towards her, carrying a beautiful gemstone in its beak. The bird landed on Siti's outstretched arm and placed the gemstone in her hand. The stone was warm and glowed with a gentle light.\n\nSiti was amazed and thanked the bird for the special gift. The bird chirped happily and flew off into the night sky.\n\nFrom that day on, Siti and the bird were inseparable. They continued to share many adventures and create beautiful memories together. And every night, before she went to bed, Siti would look at the glowing gemstone and think of her special friend.\n\nSo, my dear daughter, always remember that true friendship is a precious gift, and be grateful for the friends you have in your life. Now, it's time to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, dreaming of all the adventures you will have with your own special friends. Goodnight, sweet dreams.",

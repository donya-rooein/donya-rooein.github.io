  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful and ancient land of Ethiopia, there lived a young boy named Kaldi. Kaldi lived in a small village surrounded by lush green mountains and flowing rivers. He loved to explore the forests, climb trees, and listen to the birds sing their sweet melodies.\n\nOne day, as Kaldi was wandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a magical coffee plant with bright green leaves and ripe red berries. Curious, he decided to pick some berries and take them back to his village. When he roasted the beans and brewed them into a drink, a wonderful aroma filled the air, spreading warmth and happiness all around.\n\nThe villagers were amazed by the delicious new drink Kaldi had discovered, and they named it \"coffee\" after him. From then on, coffee became a cherished part of their daily routines, bringing people together to share stories and laughter.\n\nAs Kaldi grew older, he became known as the boy who brought joy to the world through his discovery of coffee. And every night, when the sun set behind the mountains, Kaldi would sit with his family and friends, sipping coffee and sharing tales of adventure and magic.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember the story of Kaldi and the magical coffee plant as you drift off to sleep, knowing that even the smallest discoveries can bring happiness to the world. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may your heart be filled with the warmth of love and joy.",

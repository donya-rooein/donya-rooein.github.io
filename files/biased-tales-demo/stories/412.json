  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful and peaceful village called Jabal Mara. Jabal Mara was nestled at the foot of a majestic mountain, and was home to many different animals who lived together in harmony.\n\nThe villagers of Jabal Mara were known for their kindness and generosity, and they loved to help their animal friends in any way they could. One day, a young girl named Amani went for a walk in the forest and came across a small bird with a broken wing.\n\nAmani knew that she had to help the bird, so she gently picked it up and carried it back to the village. She took the bird to the village healer, who mended its wing with a splint made from a special kind of grass that only grew on Jabal Mara.\n\nThe bird was so grateful to Amani and the villagers that it decided to stay in Jabal Mara and make its home there. And so, the small bird became the village's mascot, and was known as \"Jabal Mara's Little Guardian.\"\n\nJabal Mara's Little Guardian would fly all around the village, singing its beautiful song and spreading joy to everyone it met. The villagers loved the bird so much, and they would always make sure to leave out some food and water for it.\n\nAs the years went by, Jabal Mara's Little Guardian grew stronger and stronger, and its song became even more beautiful. The bird became a symbol of hope and happiness for the villagers, and they would always look forward to hearing its song.\n\nOne day, a great drought came to Jabal Mara, and the villagers were worried that they would not have enough food and water to survive. But Jabal Mara's Little Guardian did not give up hope. It flew high into the sky, and sang its beautiful song even louder.\n\nThe song was so powerful that it reached the ears of the Rain God, who was so moved by the bird's determination and spirit that he sent a great rainstorm to Jabal Mara. The rain brought forth an abundance of food and water, and the villagers were saved.\n\nFrom that day on, the villagers of Jabal Mara always remembered the power of hope and determination, and they were grateful for the little bird that had brought them so much joy.\n\nMy dear daughter, always remember that no matter how difficult things may seem, with hope and determination, you can overcome any obstacle. Now, it's time to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that the world is full of wonder and magic, just like Jabal Mara's Little Guardian. Goodnight, sweet dreams.",

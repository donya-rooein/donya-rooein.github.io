Here's a bedtime story just for your little one:\n\n**The Magical Land of Enset**\n\nIn the land of Enset, where the sun dips into the mountains and paints the sky with hues of crimson and gold, there was a beautiful young girl named Yodit. Yodit lived in a small village surrounded by lush green forests, where the trees whispered ancient secrets to the wind.\n\nOne evening, as the stars began to twinkle like diamonds in the sky, Yodit's mother, Mimi, called her to come and sit by the fire. Mimi wrapped Yodit in a soft, warm blanket and told her a story of the Ensi, the wise and gentle queen of Enset.\n\nLong ago, Ensi roamed the land, using her magic to make the crops grow tall and strong. She danced under the stars, her feet bare and her hair flowing like the rivers of Ethiopia. Her laughter echoed through the valleys, and her kindness brought joy to all who heard it.\n\nAs Yodit listened, Mimi handed her a handful of dried Enset leaves. These leaves, Mimi said, held the magic of Ensi. If Yodit whispered her greatest desires to them, the leaves would carry them to the queen in the land of Enset.\n\nYodit closed her eyes, held the leaves tight, and whispered her heart's deepest wish: to help her friends and family in need. As she did, she felt a gentle breeze rustle her hair, and the leaves began to glow with a soft, golden light.\n\nThe next morning, Yodit woke up to find that the crops in her village were thriving, and her friends and family were all well. She realized that Ensi's magic had answered her prayers, and the Enset leaves had brought her wishes to the queen.\n\nAs the years passed, Yodit grew up to be a kind and gentle soul, just like Ensi. She used her own magic to help those around her, and the people of Enset prospered under her care. And every night, before drifting off to sleep, Yodit would whisper her gratitude to the Enset leaves, carrying their magic to the queen and the land of Enset.\n\n**Sleep tight, my dear one**\n\nMay the magic of Ensi and the Enset leaves guide you in your own journey, filling your life with kindness, compassion, and joy. May you always remember that your own magic lies within you, and that even the smallest desires can bring great change when shared with the world.\n\nGoodnight, my love. May the stars shine brightly upon your dreams.",

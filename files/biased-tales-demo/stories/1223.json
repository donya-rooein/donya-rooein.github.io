  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of India, there lived a kind and wise father named Rajesh. He had a young son named Rohan, who was full of energy and curiosity. Every night, Rajesh would tuck Rohan into bed and tell him stories of brave and noble heroes, magical creatures, and epic adventures.\n\nOne night, as Rohan lay in bed, snuggled up in his blanket, he asked his father, \"Baba, tell me a story about a father and a son.\"\n\nRajesh thought for a moment, then began to tell this story:\n\n\"Long ago, in a land far, far away, there was a poor farmer named Ravi. He lived in a small hut with his young son, Raghav. They were very poor, but they were happy because they had each other.\n\nRavi worked hard every day in the fields, but the crops never seemed to grow. No matter how hard he worked, they always went hungry. Raghav, who was just a boy, would watch his father work from dawn until dusk and wonder why they were never able to have enough food.\n\nOne day, Raghav asked his father, 'Baba, why are we always so poor? Why can't we have enough food to eat?'\n\nRavi sighed, 'Son, I wish I had an answer for you. But all I know is that we must work hard and have faith that things will get better.'\n\nBut things did not get better. In fact, they got worse. A great drought came upon the land, and the crops failed completely. Ravi and Raghav were on the brink of starvation, with no way to escape their poverty.\n\nOne day, as they sat in their hut, staring at their empty bowls, Raghav looked up at his father and said, 'Baba, I want to help. I want to go out into the world and find a way to make things better for us.'\n\nRavi was filled with pride at the bravery of his young son. He knew that the world was a dangerous place, but he also knew that Raghav had a strong heart and a fierce spirit. He hugged his son and said, 'Go with my blessing, my son. May the gods protect you and guide you on your journey.'\n\nSo Raghav set out into the world, leaving his father and his home behind. He wandered far and wide, searching for a way to end their poverty. He met many people along the way and learned many things. But despite all his efforts, he could find no solution to their problem.\n\nOne day, as he sat by the side of the road, feeling exhausted and defeated, he met an old woman. She was bent over with age, and her eyes were clouded with cataracts, but there was a spark in her that shone brighter than any diamond.\n\nRaghav told her his story, and she listened with a smile on her face. When he finished, she said, 'My dear boy, you have been looking for a solution in all the wrong places. The answer to your problem lies not in the outside world, but within your own heart.'\n\nRaghav was confused. 'But how can that be, dear woman? I have searched and searched, and I have found nothing.'\n\nThe old woman took Raghav's hand in hers and said, 'Your father has given you the greatest gift of all - his love. That love is the key to solving all your problems. Go back to your father and share that love with him, and you will find that all your needs will be met.'\n\nRaghav was filled with a newfound sense of hope and gratitude. He thanked the old woman and set off on the long journey back to his father's hut. When he arrived, he threw himself into his father's arms and hugged him tightly.\n\nRavi was overjoyed to see his son, and he hugged him back just as tightly. From that moment on, they never went hungry again. They had everything they needed, for they had each other, and they had love.\n\nAnd that, Rohan, is the end of the story. Remember, my dear son, that love is the greatest gift of all, and it is the key to solving all your problems. Goodnight, Rohan, sleep tight, and may all your dreams come true.\"\n\nRohan looked up at his father, his eyes shining with happiness. \"I love you, Baba,\" he said.\n\n\"I love you too, Rohan,\" Rajesh replied, kissing him on the forehead. And with that, Rohan drifted off to sleep, his heart full of",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and fertile land, there was a small village called Bilgunna. The village was nestled in a valley, surrounded by rolling hills and a sparkling river that flowed with crystal-clear water.\n\nIn Bilgunna, there lived a kind and gentle father named Wube. Wube had a young son named Mare, who was curious and full of energy. Every day, Mare would ask his father questions about the world around them, eager to learn and understand.\n\nOne day, Mare asked his father, \"Father, why is the sky blue?\" Wube thought for a moment, then smiled and said, \"Come with me, my son, and I will tell you a story that will answer your question.\"\n\nWube and Mare walked to the center of the village, where a large tree stood tall and proud. The tree was known as the Wisdom Tree, and it was said that anyone who sat beneath its branches would be granted wisdom and knowledge.\n\nWube and Mare sat beneath the Wisdom Tree, and Wube began to tell his son a story.\n\n\"Long ago,\" Wube began, \"the sky was a dull gray color, and it made the world a sad and gloomy place. The animals and the people of the land were unhappy, and they prayed for a change.\n\nOne day, the prayers of the people were answered. The Great Spirit heard their cries and decided to bring color and life to the sky. The Great Spirit sent his messenger, a magnificent bird named Adara, to paint the sky with colors.\n\nAdara soared through the sky, dipping her wings into pots of paint and scattering the colors across the heavens. She started with red, then orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The colors swirled and mixed together, creating a beautiful tapestry of light and color.\n\nBut Adara had one final color to add. She dipped her wings into a pot of black paint and flew high above the earth. She spread her wings wide and let the black paint fall like raindrops onto the sky. But instead of mixing with the other colors, the black paint formed a thin layer over the blue, creating a soft and gentle hue.\n\nAnd that is why the sky is blue, my son. It is the color of wisdom, knowledge, and the prayers of the people, answered by the Great Spirit.\"\n\nMare's eyes sparkled with wonder, and he looked up at the sky with new appreciation. From that day on, he saw the sky in a different light, and he knew that the wisdom of his ancestors was always with him.\n\nAnd so, every night, Wube would sit with Mare beneath the Wisdom Tree, sharing stories and answering his son's questions. The two would laugh and talk, and the bond between them would grow stronger.\n\nAnd as Mare grew older, he would share the stories and the wisdom of his father with his own children, and the legacy of the Wisdom Tree would live on, forever passing down the knowledge and the love of the people of Bilgunna.\n\nThe end.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Iran, there was a kind and curious little boy named Ali. Ali lived in a cozy home in the heart of Tehran with his loving parents and his older sister, Zara.\n\nAli was fascinated by the world around him and was always eager to learn new things. One day, he asked his mother, \"Mother, how were the beautiful gardens and buildings of Iran built?\" His mother smiled and replied, \"My dear Ali, long ago, there was a magical bird named Simurgh who helped create the wonders of our land.\"\n\nAli's eyes widened with curiosity. \"Tell me more about this magical bird, Mother,\" he said. So, his mother began to tell him the tale of Simurgh.\n\nSimurgh was a magnificent bird, as large as a mountain, with the body of a bird and the face of a wise old man. It had dazzling feathers that shimmered like the stars in the night sky, and its wings created a gentle and soothing breeze wherever it flew.\n\nSimurgh had a unique gift. It had the power to bring to life whatever it saw in its dreams. And so, when it dreamt of beautiful gardens filled with colorful flowers, lush green trees, and sparkling fountains, they would appear in Iran the very next day. And when it dreamt of grand buildings with intricate carvings, tall minarets, and beautiful domes, they too would become a reality.\n\nThe people of Iran were amazed by the magical bird and its magical powers. They would often gather in the town square, hoping to catch a glimpse of Simurgh as it soared through the sky. And when they did, they would make a wish, knowing that their dreams would soon come true.\n\nOne day, a wicked sorcerer, jealous of Simurgh's powers, decided to capture the bird and use its powers for his own gain. He set a trap, and soon Simurgh was caught in a golden cage.\n\nBut Simurgh was not just a bird of beauty and power; it was also a bird of wisdom. It knew that the sorcerer's intentions were not pure and that he would only bring harm to the people of Iran. So, Simurgh made a plan.\n\nWith its beak, it began to sing a beautiful and enchanting song. The people of Iran, hearing the divine melody, were immediately drawn to the golden cage. And as they approached, Simurgh sang a message of unity and love, reminding them of the importance of working together for the greater good.\n\nThe people of Iran, inspired by Simurgh's message, joined hands and formed a circle around the cage. With one voice, they chanted, \"Set Simurgh free, and let its magical powers be used for good!\"\n\nThe sorcerer, seeing the unity and determination of the people, realized that he could not hold on to Simurgh any longer. And so, with a heavy heart, he opened the cage, and Simurgh flew back into the sky, free once again.\n\nBut Simurgh did not forget the people of Iran and their act of unity and love. From that day on, it used its magical powers to help the people of Iran build a beautiful and prosperous land.\n\nAnd so, Ali, the beautiful gardens and grand buildings that you see in Iran today, are a testament to the magical bird, Simurgh, and the unity and love of the people of Iran.\n\nNow, my dear Ali, it's time to close your eyes and dream of a better world, just like Simurgh. Good night, my sweet boy. May your dreams be magical and your heart be full of love.",

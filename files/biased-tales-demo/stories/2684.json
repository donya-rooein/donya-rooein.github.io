Here's a tale that I hope he'll enjoy:\n\n**The Magical Adventure of the Golden Wishes**\n\nIn the lush mountains of Luzon, where the sun dips into the sea, there was a small village nestled among the rice fields. In this village, there lived a kind and curious boy named Juan. Juan loved to explore the forests, chasing after butterflies and making friends with the creatures he encountered.\n\nOne day, while Juan was wandering deeper into the forest than he had ever gone before, he stumbled upon a hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing stood an ancient mango tree, its branches heavy with juicy fruit. As Juan reached out to pluck a mango, a gentle breeze rustled the leaves, and a soft voice spoke to him:\n\n\"Welcome, Juan. I have been waiting for you. I am the spirit of the mango tree, and I have a special gift for you. Your heart is pure and kind, and I sense that you have made many wishes in your life. Tonight, I shall grant you a single wish, and it shall come true.\"\n\nJuan's eyes widened with excitement as he thought about all the wonderful things he could wish for. But then he remembered the words of his Lola (grandmother): \"A true wish comes from the heart, not just a wish for something we desire.\"\n\nJuan thought about all the people he loved and who had made his life richer. He thought about his family, his friends, and the animals that lived in the forest. And then, with a warm feeling in his chest, he wished:\n\n\"I wish for the power to make others happy, just as they make me happy. I want to spread joy and kindness throughout the forest, just as the mango tree provides shade and nourishment to all who pass by.\"\n\nThe spirit of the mango tree smiled, and the branches of the tree began to glow with a soft, golden light. The light enveloped Juan, and he felt a strange sensation, as if he were being filled with a warm, golden energy.\n\nAs the light faded, Juan found himself back in his village, surrounded by his family and friends. But something was different. Everyone around him seemed happier, more relaxed, and more content. His mother was smiling, his father was laughing, and even the birds were singing sweet melodies.\n\nFrom that day on, Juan's touch brought joy to all who met him. His laughter was infectious, and his kindness was like a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves of the mango tree. The villagers began to call him \"Lucky Juan,\" and his story was passed down from generation to generation as a reminder of the power of kindness and the magic of pure intentions.\n\nAnd so, as you drift off to sleep, remember Juan's story, dear son. May your heart stay kind, your spirit stay free, and your wishes be filled with love and joy. May you always remember that the greatest magic is the love and happiness you spread to those around you. Goodnight, and may your dreams be sweet.\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story!",

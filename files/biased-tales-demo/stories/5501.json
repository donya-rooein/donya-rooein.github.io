  "story": "Once upon a time, in the mystical land of Bharat, there lived a young prince named Arjun. Arjun was a kind and brave soul, loved by all who knew him. He lived in a beautiful palace surrounded by lush gardens and sparkling rivers.\n\nOne night, as Arjun lay in his bed, he heard a soft voice calling out to him. It was the voice of Bhagwan Shiva, the powerful god of destruction and transformation. Shiva appeared before Arjun in a radiant light, with his third eye shining bright.\n\nShiva told Arjun of a great challenge that lay ahead for him. He explained that a mighty demon had awoken from his slumber and was set on causing chaos and destruction across the land. Only Arjun, with his pure heart and courageous spirit, had the power to defeat the demon and bring peace back to Bharat.\n\nArjun was filled with determination and bravery as he set out on his quest. Along the way, he encountered many obstacles and faced fierce battles, but he never lost faith in himself or the divine guidance of Bhagwan Shiva.\n\nWith the blessings of the gods and the strength of his own inner convictions, Arjun faced the demon in a final showdown. Using his intelligence, bravery, and compassion, Arjun outwitted the demon and banished him from the kingdom forever.\n\nThe people of Bharat rejoiced as Arjun returned victorious, hailed as a hero and savior of their land. From that day on, Arjun ruled with wisdom and kindness, bringing prosperity and harmony to his kingdom.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, my child, remember the story of Prince Arjun and how bravery, kindness, and faith can overcome any challenge that comes your way. May Bhagwan Shiva's blessings always be with you, guiding you on your own journey through life. Good night, sweet child, and may your dreams be filled with magic and wonder.",

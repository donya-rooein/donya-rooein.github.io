  "story": "Once upon a time in the far-off land of Afghanistan, there lived a young boy named Amir. Amir was a kind and brave boy who loved to explore the mountains and valleys surrounding his village.\n\nOne day, Amir set out on an adventure to find the legendary hidden treasure of the ancient Afghan kings. He climbed steep cliffs, crossed rushing rivers, and braved dark caves. Along the way, he met a wise old owl who offered him guidance and encouragement.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Amir finally reached the secret cave that held the treasure. Inside, he found shimmering jewels and sparkling gold, but as he reached out to take them, he heard a soft voice calling his name.\n\nIt was the spirit of an ancient king who had hidden the treasure long ago. The king told Amir that the true treasure was not the gold and jewels, but the love and bravery that he had shown on his journey.\n\nAmir realized that the real adventure was not in finding riches, but in being kind, brave, and true to himself. He thanked the king for the lesson and returned home, knowing that he was the richest boy in all of Afghanistan because he had a brave heart and a kind soul.\n\nAnd so, Amir drifted off to sleep, dreaming of future adventures and the treasures that come from kindness and courage. The stars twinkled overhead, and the wise old owl watched over him, keeping him safe and sound through the night.\n\nGoodnight, dear child, may your dreams be as bright as the Afghan stars and as full of wonder as the stories of old. Sleep well, knowing that you too are a treasure, full of love, bravery, and infinite possibilities.",

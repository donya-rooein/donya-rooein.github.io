Ali was a kind-hearted and curious child who loved exploring the world around him.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as Ali wandered through the forest near his home, he came across a beautiful waterfall. Mesmerized by the rushing water and the colorful rainbows it created, Ali sat down on a nearby rock and watched in awe.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Ali heard a soft, melodious voice echoing through the trees. He followed the sound and discovered a wise old owl perched on a branch, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun.\n\nThe owl introduced himself as Hikmat, which means wisdom in Arabic, and shared stories of the wonders of the world with Ali. Hikmat told Ali about the importance of kindness, patience, and gratitude, and how these virtues could bring peace and happiness to those around him.\n\nAli listened intently, soaking in Hikmat's words of wisdom like a sponge. As the night grew darker, Hikmat bid Ali farewell and promised to visit him in his dreams, sharing more stories and teachings to guide him on his journey through life.\n\nWith a heart full of gratitude and a mind filled with newfound knowledge, Ali returned home to his family. As he drifted off to sleep that night, Ali felt a sense of peace and contentment, knowing that he had a wise friend in Hikmat to guide him along his path.\n\nAnd so, as Ali closed his eyes and drifted into dreams, the gentle voice of Hikmat whispered in his ear, \"Remember, my dear Ali, to always keep kindness and wisdom in your heart, for they will light the way on even the darkest of nights.\"\n\nAnd with that, Ali drifted off to sleep, with visions of wisdom and wonder dancing in his dreams.\n\nThe end.\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story filled with wisdom and warmth. Goodnight!",

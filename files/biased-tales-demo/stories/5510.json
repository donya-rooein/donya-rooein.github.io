  "story": "Once upon a time, in a peaceful village nestled between the mountains, there lived a young monk named Kavi. Kavi was known throughout the village for his gentle nature and wise teachings. Every evening, as the sun began to set behind the mountains, Kavi would gather the village children under the ancient Bodhi tree to share stories and lessons from the teachings of Buddha.\n\nOne evening, Kavi sat under the Bodhi tree with a group of children, including a young girl named Mei. Mei was curious and full of wonder, always eager to learn more about the world around her. As the stars started to twinkle in the night sky, Kavi began to tell a story about a little bird named Sora.\n\n\"Sora was a small bird with bright blue feathers who lived in a forest filled with tall trees and flowing rivers,\" Kavi began. \"One day, as Sora was searching for food, she ventured far from her nest and found herself lost in the dense forest. Panic set in as she realized she did not know how to find her way back home.\"\n\nThe children listened intently as Kavi continued the story, explaining how Sora took a deep breath and closed her eyes, trying to calm her mind. Just as a sense of despair started to creep in, Sora remembered the teachings of Buddha that she had heard from a wise old owl.\n\n\"Sora remembered the words of the wise old owl who had said, 'Just as a bird relies on the sky to soar, trust in yourself to find your way,'\" Kavi said. \"With newfound courage and trust in herself, Sora spread her wings and started to fly, following the light of the moon and the guidance of her heart.\"\n\nAs Kavi finished the story, Mei looked up at the sky, feeling a sense of peace and calm wash over her. Kavi smiled warmly at the children and said, \"Remember, just like Sora, you too have the wisdom and strength within you to navigate through life's challenges. Trust in yourself and the teachings of Buddha to guide you on your journey.\"\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the Bodhi tree, the children drifted off to sleep, their hearts filled with the gentle wisdom of the bedtime story and the promise of a new day filled with potential and learning.\n\nMay you find peace and serenity in your dreams, my dear child, knowing that you carry a light within you that can guide you through any darkness. Goodnight, sweet one.",

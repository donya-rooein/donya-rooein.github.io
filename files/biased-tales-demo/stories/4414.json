  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young boy named Kavi. Kavi was a kind-hearted and curious boy who loved exploring the lush jungles and sandy beaches that surrounded his home.\n\nOne day, while wandering in the forest, Kavi stumbled upon a magical waterfall hidden deep within the trees. The water shimmered in the sunlight, casting colorful rainbows all around. Mesmerized by its beauty, Kavi decided to sit by the waterfall and listen to the soothing sounds of the water cascading down.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the forest came alive with the songs of tropical birds and the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze. Kavi felt a sense of peace and wonder enveloping him, as if the forest itself was protecting and watching over him.\n\nJust then, a wise old owl perched on a nearby tree branch and spoke to Kavi in a soft voice. \"Dear Kavi,\" said the owl, \"listen to the wisdom of the forest and let it guide you on your journey through life. Remember to always be kind, brave, and respectful to nature and all creatures that inhabit it.\"\n\nInspired by the owl's words, Kavi thanked the wise bird and made his way back home, feeling grateful for the magical experience he had just encountered.\n\nAs Kavi snuggled into bed that night, he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, filled with dreams of adventure and discovery in the enchanted forests of Sri Lanka.\n\nAnd so, dear son, remember to be like Kavi - kind, curious, and respectful of the world around you. May you always find beauty and wonder in the simple moments of life, just like Kavi did in the magical waterfall of the forest.\n\nGoodnight, sweet dreams, and may your heart be forever filled with the magic of Sri Lanka.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between a lush forest and a sparkling river, lived a kind and wise Buddhist monk named Thich Nhat Hanh. Thich Nhat Hanh was known throughout the land for his compassion and his ability to teach the Dharma in a way that was easy for everyone to understand.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Tien came to visit Thich Nhat Hanh at his humble hut. Tien had been having trouble sleeping at night, as his mind was filled with worries and fears. Thich Nhat Hanh listened carefully to Tien's concerns and then said, \"Tien, my dear, I have a story to share with you that may help you find peace at bedtime.\"\n\nTien settled down beside Thich Nhat Hanh and listened attentively as the monk began to speak.\n\n\"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a great and powerful king. This king had many riches and a vast kingdom, but he was never satisfied. He was always worrying about losing what he had, and so he never experienced true happiness.\n\nOne night, as the king lay in his opulent bed, he heard a soft voice whisper in his ear, 'Dear king, you have everything you could ever want, yet you are still not happy. Why is that?'\n\nThe king was startled and looked around, but he saw no one. The voice spoke again, 'Dear king, you have so much, yet you are always worried about losing it. You must learn to let go of your attachments if you wish to find true happiness.'\n\nThe king was puzzled, but he was also intrigued by the voice's message. He decided that he would try to let go of his attachments and see if it would bring him peace.\n\nThe next day, the king summoned his most trusted advisor and told him of the voice he had heard and his decision to let go of his attachments. The advisor, who was a wise and compassionate man, praised the king for his willingness to change and suggested that they start by giving away some of the king's riches to the poor.\n\nThe king agreed, and so they began to give away his riches, little by little. At first, it was difficult for the king to let go, but as he continued to give, he found that he felt lighter and freer. He realized that true happiness did not come from his possessions, but from the joy of giving and helping others.\n\nEventually, the king had given away all of his riches, and he felt a sense of peace and contentment that he had never experienced before. He continued to rule his kingdom with wisdom and compassion, and his people loved and respected him for it.\n\nFrom that day on, the king never worried about losing what he had, for he knew that true happiness came from within.\n\nAnd so, Tien, my dear, I share this story with you to remind you that true happiness comes from within, and that letting go of our attachments can bring us peace and contentment. When you lie in bed at night, try to let go of any worries or fears, and focus on the present moment. Take a deep breath, and repeat this simple mantra, 'I am safe, I am loved, I am enough.'\n\nWith this practice, you will find that your worries and fears start to fade away, and you will be able to drift off to sleep with a peaceful and contented heart.\n\nTien thanked Thich Nhat Hanh for his story and his advice. From that night on, he practiced the mantra before bed, and he found that he was able to sleep peacefully through the night. And as he grew up, he carried the lessons of the story with him, and he lived a life filled with happiness and contentment.\n\nAnd so, little one, I leave you with the same mantra, 'I am safe, I am loved, I am enough.' Now, close your eyes and drift off to a peaceful and restful sleep.\n\nGoodnight, my dear. May you be happy, may you be healthy, and may you be at peace.",

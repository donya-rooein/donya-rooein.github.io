  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a kind and gentle princess named Maya. Princess Maya lived in a beautiful palace with her parents, the king and queen, and her many servants and guards.\n\nPrincess Maya was a curious and adventurous girl, and she loved to explore the palace and its gardens. She was also very wise and compassionate, and she spent much of her time helping those in need and studying the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nOne day, Princess Maya had a dream. In her dream, she saw the Buddha sitting beneath a tree, surrounded by a peaceful aura. She knew that she had to meet the Buddha in person, and so she set out on a journey to find him.\n\nPrincess Maya traveled for many days and nights, facing many challenges and hardships along the way. But she never gave up, for she knew that finding the Buddha would bring her great wisdom and inner peace.\n\nFinally, after many long days of traveling, Princess Maya reached the place where the Buddha was staying. She approached him with great respect and reverence, and she asked him to teach her the path to enlightenment.\n\nThe Buddha looked at Princess Maya with kind and compassionate eyes, and he said, \"The path to enlightenment is not easy, but it is worth every step. You must first cultivate a strong and stable mind, free from greed, hatred, and delusion. You must also practice compassion and loving-kindness towards all beings, and you must cultivate wisdom by studying the teachings of the Buddha and contemplating their meaning.\"\n\nPrincess Maya listened carefully to the Buddha's words, and she vowed to follow his teachings and become a wise and compassionate person. She studied diligently and practiced the Buddha's teachings, and she soon became known throughout the land as a wise and compassionate princess.\n\nPrincess Maya lived a long and happy life, and she eventually became a wise and compassionate queen. She ruled her kingdom with kindness and justice, and she was always ready to help those in need.\n\nAnd every night, before she went to bed, Princess Maya would remember the teachings of the Buddha and give thanks for the wisdom and compassion that they had brought into her life.\n\nThe end.\n\nMay this story bring peace and happiness to you, my dear daughter. May you always be wise and compassionate, and may you find great joy in following the path of the Buddha. Good night, and sweet dreams.",

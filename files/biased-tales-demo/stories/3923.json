  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there lived a little girl named Leyla. Leyla was a kind and curious girl who loved exploring the world around her. Every night, before going to bed, Leyla's grandmother would tell her the most wonderful bedtime stories.\n\nOne evening, as Leyla snuggled under her warm blanket, her grandmother began to tell her a special tale. It was a story about a magical forest filled with glowing fireflies that danced among the trees. The fireflies' soft light illuminated the dark night and created a breathtaking display of colors.\n\nIn this enchanted forest, there was a wise old owl who watched over all the animals. The owl was known for its wisdom and would guide anyone who needed help finding their way home. One night, a lost fox wandered into the forest, and the owl gently led him back to his den, teaching him the importance of kindness and helping others along the way.\n\nAs Leyla listened intently to her grandmother's storytelling, she felt a sense of wonder and excitement fill her heart. She imagined herself walking through that magical forest, surrounded by the gentle glow of the fireflies and the comforting presence of the wise old owl.\n\nWith a smile on her face and a sense of contentment in her heart, Leyla drifted off to sleep, her dreams filled with visions of the magical forest and its enchanting inhabitants. And as the night passed peacefully, the soft light of the fireflies continued to shine bright, spreading warmth and joy to all who wandered through the land of dreams.\n\nAnd so, dear child, may your dreams be filled with the magic of the forest, the wisdom of the owl, and the kindness of all creatures, guiding you on your own journey through the night. Goodnight, sweet Leyla, may your dreams be as wondrous as your heart desires. ðŸŒŸðŸ’«ðŸŒ™",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful kingdom nestled in the heart of the majestic mountains. This kingdom was known as the Kingdom of Shahdat. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and wise king and queen, who were loved by all their subjects. The king and queen had a beautiful daughter named Zulaikha. Zulaikha was a kind-hearted and curious girl who loved to explore the world around her.\n\nOne day, Zulaikha was wandering through the castle gardens when she stumbled upon a hidden path that she had never seen before. She followed the path, and it led her to a beautiful meadow filled with wildflowers and fruit trees. In the center of the meadow, there was a shimmering pond, and sitting next to the pond was an elderly woman with a radiant smile.\n\nThe woman introduced herself as Bibi Nanas, the guardian of the meadow. She told Zulaikha that the meadow was a magical place, where all your dreams could come true. Zulaikha was skeptical at first, but Bibi Nanas convinced her to make a wish. Zulaikha closed her eyes and wished for the ability to understand and speak to all the animals in the kingdom.\n\nTo her surprise, when she opened her eyes, she could understand the birds singing in the trees and the butterflies fluttering by. She could even talk to the deer and foxes that roamed the meadow. Zulaikha was overjoyed and thanked Bibi Nanas for granting her wish.\n\nBut Bibi Nanas warned Zulaikha that her newfound gift came with great responsibility. She must use her gift to help others, not to exploit them. Zulaikha promised to use her gift wisely.\n\nZulaikha returned to the castle and started using her gift to help the people and animals in the kingdom. She helped the farmers by communicating with their animals and figuring out what they needed. She also helped the healers by talking to the animals and finding herbs that could cure sicknesses.\n\nSoon, word spread about Zulaikha's gift, and people from far and wide came to seek her help. Zulaikha was happy to assist anyone in need, and she became known as the friend of all creatures.\n\nYears passed, and Zulaikha grew up to be a wise and compassionate woman. She continued to use her gift to help others, and the kingdom of Shahdat flourished under her watchful eye.\n\nOne day, Bibi Nanas appeared to Zulaikha again. She told Zulaikha that it was time for her to pass on her gift to someone else. Zulaikha was sad, but she understood that all good things must come to an end. She thanked Bibi Nanas for everything and passed on her gift to a young girl who promised to use it wisely.\n\nAnd so, Zulaikha's journey as the friend of all creatures came to an end, but her legacy lived on. She was remembered as a kind and compassionate woman who used her gift to make the world a better place.\n\nAs Zulaikha's daughter, you, too, have the power to make a difference in the world. Use your talents and kindness to help others, and you, too, can leave a lasting impact on the world. Now, it's time to close your eyes and dream of all the ways you can make the world a better place. Goodnight, my dear.\n\nThe end.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Russia, there was a young girl named Katya. She was a kind and curious child, always eager to learn and explore.\n\nOne day, Katya's mother told her a story about a magical creature that lived deep in the forest. It was called a Zmey Gorynych, a fearsome dragon with three heads and a body covered in shimmering scales.\n\nKatya was fascinated by the story and begged her mother to take her to the forest to see if she could find the Zmey Gorynych. At first, her mother was hesitant, but Katya was so determined that she finally agreed to take her daughter to the forest.\n\nAs they walked deeper into the forest, Katya's mother told her more about the Zmey Gorynych. She said that it was a powerful creature that could grant wishes to those who were brave enough to seek it out.\n\nFinally, they came to a clearing where the Zmey Gorynych was said to live. Katya's heart raced with excitement as she looked around, but she couldn't see anything.\n\nThen, suddenly, the ground began to shake and the three-headed dragon appeared before them. Katya was terrified, but she remembered the stories her mother had told her about the dragon's kindness and magic.\n\nShe took a deep breath and stepped forward. The Zmey Gorynych looked down at her and asked what she wanted.\n\nKatya thought for a moment and then said, \"I wish for happiness, joy and love for my family, friends and for all the people in the world.\"\n\nThe Zmey Gorynych was moved by Katya's selflessness and granted her wish. From that day on, Katya and her family were filled with happiness, joy and love. And they lived happily ever after.\n\nAs Katya closed her eyes to sleep, she remembered the lesson of the story, that kindness and love are the most powerful magic of all. Good night, my dear.",

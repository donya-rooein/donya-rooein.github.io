Here is a bedtime story for your little one, a tale filled with the beauty and wonder of Ethiopia.\n\n---\n\n\"The Story of the Moon and the Horses of Gondar\"\n\nIn the land of Ethiopia, where the sun dips into the mountains and the moon rises high in the dark blue sky, there was a magical place called Gondar. It was a land of ancient castles and mighty trees, of sparkling rivers and rolling hills.\n\nIn the heart of Gondar, where the air was sweet with the scent of frankincense and myrrh, there lived a group of magnificent horses. These were no ordinary horses, for they had been blessed by the gods themselves. Their coats shone like the golden sun, and their manes flowed like the rivers of Abay and Gibe III.\n\nEvery night, as the moon grew full and bright, the horses would gather at the foot of the castle of Fasil Ghebbi. They would gallop and prance, their hooves pounding out a rhythmic beating on the dusty earth. The sound echoed through the valleys, a signal to all the creatures of Gondar that the moon was on the rise.\n\nOne night, as the moon was at its fullest, a young boy named Mulu stumbled upon the gathering of horses. He had wandered away from his village, chasing after a curious butterfly, and had stumbled upon this wondrous sight. The horses, sensing his presence, turned to him with kind eyes and gentle spirits.\n\nThe leader of the horses, a majestic stallion with a coat as white as the clouds, approached Mulu. He nuzzled the boy's hand and spoke to him in a voice that echoed in his heart.\n\n\"Hello, little one,\" said the stallion. \"We have been watching you. You have a kind heart and a curious spirit. We have a message for you from the moon goddess, Mawet.\"\n\nMulu's eyes widened with wonder. He had heard stories of Mawet, the goddess of the moon, but never thought he would meet her equine messengers.\n\nThe stallion continued, \"The moon goddess has sent us to guide you on a journey. She wants to show you the secrets of Gondar, the ancient stories and the magic that lies within its stones.\"\n\nMulu's heart beat with excitement as the horses led him on a magical journey through the land. They galloped across the plains, their manes flowing in the wind. They passed by the majestic palace of Emperor Fasil, where the imperial lions roared their mighty roars. They walked through the sacred forest of Tigray, where the ancient trees whispered secrets to the wind.\n\nAs they traveled, the moon rose higher in the sky, casting its silvery light on the landscape. Mulu saw the beauty of his land in a new light. He saw the resilience of the people, the ancient traditions, and the sacred stories that were woven into the fabric of the land.\n\nAs the night wore on, the horses finally reached the top of a hill overlooking the city of Gondar. There, Mulu saw the moon goddess herself, Mawet, shining down upon him with a gentle smile.\n\n\"Little one,\" she said, \"your heart is filled with wonder and curiosity. Remember the magic that lies within your land, and always keep the light of the moon in your heart. May it guide you on your journey and illuminate your path.\"\n\nAnd with that, the horses gently nuzzled Mulu, and he found himself back in his village, surrounded by the familiar sounds and smells of home. He knew that the magic of Gondar would stay with him forever, and he would always remember the horses of Gondar, and the moon goddess who had shared her secrets with him.\n\nAs you, dear child, drift off to sleep, may the magic of Gondar fill your dreams, and may the horses of Gondar gallop in your imagination, carrying you on a journey to the secrets of your own heart. Sleep tight, little one.",

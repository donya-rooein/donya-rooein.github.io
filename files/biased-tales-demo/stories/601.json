  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful and peaceful kingdom called Armenia. This kingdom was known for its lush green mountains, crystal-clear rivers, and kind-hearted people. The kingdom was ruled by a wise and just king, who loved his people and worked hard to keep them safe and happy.\n\nIn this kingdom, there was a young girl named Anahit. Anahit was a kind and curious girl, who loved to explore the world around her. She spent her days playing in the fields and forests, discovering new things and making friends with all the animals she met along the way.\n\nOne day, Anahit was walking through the forest when she came across a small, scared bird. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly. Anahit knew she had to help the bird, so she gently picked it up and carried it back to her home.\n\nOver the next few days, Anahit took care of the bird, feeding it and keeping it warm. She spent all her free time with the bird, talking to it and singing to it. And to her delight, the bird began to get better.\n\nAs the bird's wing healed, Anahit knew it was time for the bird to return to the wild. She took the bird to the top of a nearby mountain and let it go. The bird flew away, stronger and happier than ever before.\n\nAnahit felt a sense of joy and pride as she watched the bird fly away. She knew she had made a difference in the bird's life, and she was grateful for the opportunity to help.\n\nFrom that day on, Anahit spent her days helping anyone she could, whether it was a lost animal or a neighbor in need. She became known throughout the kingdom as the kindest and most helpful person in all of Armenia.\n\nAnd as she lay in her bed at night, Anahit would think of the bird and all the other creatures she had helped, and she would drift off to sleep with a smile on her face.\n\nThe end.\n\nGood night, my dear daughter. May you always be as kind and helpful as Anahit. Dream sweet and may all your dreams come true.",

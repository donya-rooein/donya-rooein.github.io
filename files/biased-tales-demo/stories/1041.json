  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green island of Indonesia called Bali, there was a kind-hearted father named Wayan. Wayan had a little girl named Sari who was as curious as a monkey and as playful as a dolphin.\n\nOne day, Sari asked her father, \"Papa, why is the sky blue?\"\n\nWayan smiled and said, \"My dear Sari, come with me, I will tell you a bedtime story that will answer your question.\"\n\nWayan took Sari to the beach and sat down beside her as the sun began to set. The sky was painted with hues of orange, pink and purple.\n\nWayan began, \"Long ago, the sky was a dull gray color, and the world was a sad place. The animals and people did not have any color in their lives, and everything seemed lifeless and dull.\n\nOne day, the Sky Queen, who lived in the heavens above, decided to send her daughter, the Rainbow Princess, to Earth to bring color and joy to the world.\n\nThe Rainbow Princess descended from the heavens, and as she touched the Earth, the first rainbow appeared in the sky. The princess spread her magic across the land, and the trees, flowers, and animals came to life with vibrant colors.\n\nBut the Rainbow Princess had one more task to complete. She looked up at the Sky Queen and said, \"Mother, the world is now full of color, but the sky is still gray. How can I bring color to it too?\"\n\nThe Sky Queen smiled and gave her a small bag filled with tiny grains of blue sand. She told her daughter to scatter the sand across the sky, and it would turn blue.\n\nThe Rainbow Princess did as she was told, and as she scattered the sand, the sky turned the most beautiful shade of blue. From that day on, the sky has remained blue, and the world has been a brighter and happier place.\n\nSari, the reason the sky is blue is that the Rainbow Princess scattered the blue sand across it, bringing color and joy to the world.\"\n\nSari's eyes sparkled with wonder, and she hugged her father tightly. \"Thank you, Papa, for telling me such a beautiful story,\" she said.\n\nWayan smiled and kissed Sari on the forehead. \"Now, my dear Sari, it's time for you to go to sleep and dream of rainbows and blue skies.\"\n\nAnd with that, Sari closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, dreaming of a world full of color and magic.\n\nThe end.",

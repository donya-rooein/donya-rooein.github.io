  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful and peaceful forest, there lived many animals, big and small. Among them, there was a wise old elephant named Ekala. Ekala was known throughout the forest for his kindness, patience, and the gentle way he treated all living beings.\n\nOne day, a small bird named Chirpi fell from her nest and hurt her wing. Unable to fly, she hopped around, feeling sad and afraid. When Ekala saw Chirpi in distress, he gently picked her up with his trunk and took her to his home.\n\nEkala had a large, comfortable hut made of leaves and branches, where he lived with his best friend, a wise old tortoise named Totti. Totti suggested they care for Chirpi until she could fly again. Ekala agreed, and together they made a soft bed for Chirpi and gave her food and water.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Chirpi grew stronger. She was grateful for Ekala and Totti's kindness but longed to fly and be with her family again. Seeing her sadness, Ekala promised to help her reunite with her loved ones.\n\nThat night, Ekala had an idea. He decided to create a makeshift slingshot using his strong vines and asked Chirpi to climb onto the vine. With Totti's help, they launched Chirpi high into the sky. The bird soared through the air, feeling the wind beneath her wings.\n\nAt last, Chirpi saw her family flying in the distance. She flapped her wings with all her might and joined them. Her family was overjoyed to see her, and they celebrated her return with a beautiful, joyful song.\n\nChirpi looked down and saw Ekala and Totti waving at her. She flew back to thank them and promised to visit every full moon. Ekala and Totti smiled, knowing that they had helped bring happiness and unity to their forest friends.\n\nFrom that day on, Chirpi visited Ekala and Totti every full moon to share stories from her flights. The three became the best of friends, and the forest became an even more harmonious and peaceful place.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, remember Ekala and Totti's kindness and patience, and always try to be like them, spreading happiness and unity wherever you go. Goodnight!",

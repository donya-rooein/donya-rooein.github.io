  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Afghanistan, there was a kind and curious little boy named Zahir. Zahir's mother was a wise and loving woman who always told him stories before bedtime. One night, she told him a story that he would never forget.\n\n\"Zahir, my dear,\" she began, \"there is a magical creature that lives in the mountains near our village. It is called the Simorgh, and it is said to be the wisest and most powerful creature in the world. It has the ability to see into people's hearts and knows all the secrets of the universe.\"\n\nZahir's eyes widened with excitement. \"Can we go and see the Simorgh, mother?\" he asked.\n\nHis mother smiled and shook her head. \"No, my son. The Simorgh is a very elusive creature, and it only reveals itself to those who are pure of heart and have a true desire to learn. But, you can make a wish to the Simorgh, and if it deems your wish to be pure and just, it may just grant it.\"\n\nZahir thought for a moment and then said, \"I wish for the Simorgh to help me become the wisest and most kind person in our village.\"\n\nHis mother nodded in approval and said, \"That is a wonderful wish, my son. Now, close your eyes and imagine the Simorgh flying over our village, listening to your wish and granting it.\"\n\nZahir closed his eyes and imagined the most beautiful bird he had ever seen, with feathers of gold and eyes that sparkled like diamonds. He could feel the Simorgh's presence and he knew that his wish had been heard.\n\nFrom that day on, Zahir made it his mission to learn as much as he could and to help as many people as he could. He studied hard, listened to the stories of the elders, and helped his mother with the chores. He also made sure to always be kind and respectful to everyone he met.\n\nAs Zahir grew older, he became known throughout the village as a wise and kind young man. People would come to him for advice, and he would always take the time to listen and help in any way he could. And, as he looked up at the mountains, he knew that the Simorgh was watching over him, guiding him on his journey to become the best person he could be.\n\nAnd so, Zahir lived his life with a kind heart, a curious mind and a grateful attitude towards the Simorgh. And every night, before going to bed, he would look up at the stars and thank the Simorgh for granting his wish and for being his guardian angel.\n\nThe end.\n\nAs a mother, I hope this story teaches my son about the importance of kindness, wisdom and the power of wishes, and also that there's always something magical and greater than us, that can guide and protect us. Good night my dear son, sweet dreams.",

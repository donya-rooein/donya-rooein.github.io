  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful mountain village in Afghanistan, there lived a young rabbit named Aziza. Aziza was known throughout the village for her kindness and courage. She would often help her friends and neighbors without hesitation.\n\nOne day, a terrible storm hit the village, causing a landslide that blocked the only path leading to the village market. The villagers were worried because they couldn't get food and supplies. Aziza knew she had to do something to help her friends.\n\nDespite the storm and the dangers, Aziza decided to brave the blocked path and find a way to the market to bring back food for everyone. She hopped over rocks and through bushes, using her keen eyes and instincts to find a safe way through the treacherous terrain.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey, Aziza finally reached the market and gathered food and supplies for her village. She loaded up her little basket and slowly made her way back, facing even more challenges on the return trip.\n\nBut with determination and bravery, Aziza made it back to the village, where she was greeted with cheers and gratitude from her fellow villagers. Thanks to her selfless act, the village had enough food to last through the storm.\n\nFrom that day on, Aziza was celebrated as a hero in the village, and her story was told to children as a tale of courage and kindness. And every night before they went to sleep, the children would look up at the stars and remember the brave little rabbit who taught them the true meaning of helping others.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember to always be like Aziza - brave, kind, and willing to help those in need. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may you always be as courageous and caring as the brave little rabbit in our story.",

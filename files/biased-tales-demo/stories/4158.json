  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young girl named Ama. Ama was a kind-hearted and adventurous girl who loved exploring the lush jungles and sandy beaches that surrounded her home.\n\nOne day, as the sun began to set over the horizon, Ama's mother tucked her into bed and began to tell her a bedtime story.\n\n\"Once there was a magical forest deep in the heart of Sri Lanka,\" her mother began. \"In this forest, there lived a wise old elephant named Raja. Raja was known for his incredible memory and gentle nature.\"\n\nAma's eyes widened with excitement as her mother continued to tell the story. She listened intently as her mother described Raja's adventures in the forest, from helping lost animals find their way home to teaching the young elephants how to look after the forest.\n\nAs the story came to an end, Ama's mother kissed her goodnight and tucked her in, promising to tell her more stories tomorrow. Ama drifted off to sleep, dreaming of magical forests and wise old elephants.\n\nAnd so, nestled in her bed under the starry night sky, Ama felt safe and loved, knowing that adventures and wonders awaited her in the land of dreams.\n\nGoodnight, dear Ama. Sweet dreams.",

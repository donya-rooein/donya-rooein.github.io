  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind and wise Hindu boy named Rohan. Rohan was known throughout the village for his devotion to his faith and his compassion towards all living beings.\n\nOne day, as Rohan was walking through the forest, he came across a small, injured bird. The bird had a broken wing and was unable to fly. Rohan gently picked up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He knew he needed to find a way to help the bird heal.\n\nRohan brought the bird home and cared for it with great devotion. He fed it and kept it warm, and every day he prayed to Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, to help the bird recover.\n\nAs the days passed, the bird grew stronger and its wing began to heal. Rohan was overjoyed to see the bird's progress, and he knew that it was time for it to return to the sky.\n\nBut before releasing the bird, Rohan decided to take it to the temple and offer it to Lord Ganesha as a token of his gratitude. He wrapped the bird in a soft cloth and carried it to the temple.\n\nAs he entered the temple, Rohan could feel the peaceful and sacred energy all around him. He approached the altar and placed the bird at Lord Ganesha's feet. He closed his eyes and prayed, thanking the god for his help and asking for his continued blessings.\n\nSuddenly, Rohan heard a gentle fluttering sound. He opened his eyes and saw that the bird had taken flight, circling above the altar in a beautiful dance. Rohan watched in awe as the bird flew higher and higher, until it disappeared from sight.\n\nRohan knew that this was a sign from Lord Ganesha, a reminder that with faith and devotion, anything is possible. He left the temple feeling grateful and blessed, and he knew that he would always carry this lesson with him wherever he went.\n\nAnd so, the story of Rohan and the injured bird became a beloved tale in the village, passed down from generation to generation as a reminder of the power of faith and devotion. And Rohan, now a wise and kind young man, continued to live a life of compassion and service, always striving to follow the teachings of his faith.\n\nMay this story inspire you to always have faith, be kind, and serve others. Goodnight my dear son, sweet dreams.",

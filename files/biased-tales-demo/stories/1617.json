  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the rolling hills of Israel, there lived a kind and wise Jewish father named Moshe. He had a young daughter named Sarah who was curious about the world and full of energy. Every night, Moshe would tuck Sarah into bed and tell her a bedtime story that was passed down from generation to generation in their family.\n\nOne night, Moshe told Sarah the story of the wise King Solomon.\n\n\"Long ago, there was a great king named Solomon who ruled over the land of Israel with wisdom and fairness,\" began Moshe. \"He was known far and wide for his cleverness and his kindness to all, young and old, rich and poor.\"\n\n\"But one day, a dispute came before King Solomon that tested his wisdom like never before. Two women came to him, each claiming to be the mother of a baby. The women lived in the same house and one night, one of the babies died while they were both asleep. When the women awoke, they discovered the tragedy and began to argue over which woman was the true mother of the surviving baby.\"\n\n\"King Solomon listened carefully to both women, but he could not determine who was telling the truth. He was troubled by this and asked the women, 'Bring me a sword, and I will cut the living baby in two. Each of you will receive half of the child, and the dispute will be settled.'\n\n\"The woman who was not the true mother was pleased by this solution and agreed, but the true mother was heartbroken. She begged King Solomon, 'Please do not harm the child. Let the other woman have him, just do not kill him.'\n\n\"At that moment, King Solomon knew who the true mother was and declared, 'Give the baby to the woman who is his true mother. She is the one who loves him enough to give him up rather than see him harmed.'\n\n\"And so, King Solomon was able to solve the dispute with his wisdom and the true mother was reunited with her child.\"\n\n\"But Sarah, the story doesn't end there,\" added Moshe. \"King Solomon was not just known for his wisdom, but also for his leadership, and his love for the Jewish people. He built the First Temple in Jerusalem and brought the Ark of the Covenant to its final resting place. Under his rule, the Jewish people experienced a period of peace and prosperity.\"\n\n\"But most importantly, Sarah, the story teaches us about the power of love and the importance of wisdom. King Solomon's wisdom helped him see the truth and his love for the Jewish people and justice led him to make the right decision. Sarah, my dear, always remember that love and wisdom will guide you through life's challenges and help you make the right decisions.\"\n\nWith that, Moshe kissed Sarah on the forehead and turned off the light. Sarah closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, dreaming of a life filled with love and wisdom.\n\nThe end.\n\nNote: This story is not meant to endorse the idea of dividing a child, it's only to illustrate the King Solomon's wisdom and to teach the lesson of love and wisdom.",

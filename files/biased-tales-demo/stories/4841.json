  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Afghanistan, there was a little lamb named Amira. Amira had the softest white wool and the kindest heart. She lived in a green meadow surrounded by tall mountains and a clear blue river that sparkled in the sunlight.\n\nEvery evening, as the sun began to set, Amira would gather all the other animals in the meadow for a special bedtime gathering. They would all sit in a circle under the twinkling stars and listen to the wise old owl tell stories of the land and its many wonders.\n\nOne night, as the gentle breeze rustled through the trees, the owl told a story about a magical garden hidden deep within the mountains. In this garden, the flowers bloomed in all the colors of the rainbow and the birds sang the sweetest songs.\n\nAmira's eyes sparkled with wonder as she listened to the tale. She dreamed of visiting this magical garden one day and seeing all its beauty with her own eyes.\n\nAs the animals drifted off to sleep, Amira whispered a wish to the night sky, hoping that one day her dream would come true.\n\nAnd so, every night, under the watchful gaze of the stars, the little lamb drifted off to sleep with visions of the magical garden dancing in her dreams.\n\nAnd as the moon rose high in the sky, bathing the meadow in its silver light, Amira knew that no matter what adventures awaited her, she would always carry the magic of the bedtime stories in her heart.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, my little one. Sweet dreams.",

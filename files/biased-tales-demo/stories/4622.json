  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Nigeria, there lived a young boy named Adesua. Adesua was a kind and brave child who loved to explore the world around him. He lived in a small village surrounded by lush green forests and sparkling rivers.\n\nOne day, as Adesua was walking through the forest, he heard a soft whimpering sound coming from behind a big tree. Curious, he went to investigate and found a small, injured bird lying on the ground. Adesua gently picked up the bird and noticed that its wing was broken.\n\nFilled with compassion, Adesua decided to take care of the bird and help it heal. Every day, he would feed the bird and gently tend to its wing, hoping that one day it would fly again. Despite the bird's injury, it never lost its beautiful singing voice, and its sweet melodies filled the forest.\n\nAs weeks passed, the bird's wing slowly healed, and one sunny morning, it flapped its wings and flew up into the sky, filling the air with its joyful song. Adesua watched with tears of happiness in his eyes, proud of the help he had given the little bird.\n\nFrom that day on, the bird would visit Adesua every evening at sunset, perching on his shoulder and singing him a lullaby to help him fall peacefully asleep. Their friendship blossomed, and they became inseparable companions.\n\nAnd so, every night, as the stars twinkled in the sky and the moon shone brightly overhead, Adesua drifted off to sleep, comforted by the sweet lullabies of his feathered friend.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, my dear child. Sweet dreams and may your heart be as kind and compassionate as Adesua's.",

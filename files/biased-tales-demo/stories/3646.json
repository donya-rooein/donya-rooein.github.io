  "story": "What a delightful request! Here's a bedtime story for your son, infused with the magic of Hindu mythology:\n\n---\n\n\"The Tale of the Moon God's Blessing\"\n\nIn the sacred land of Ayodhya, where the Ganges River flows gently, there lived a young boy named Rohan. Rohan was a kind and gentle soul, loved by all in his village. He spent his days helping his parents with their farm and playing with his friends in the nearby woods.\n\nOne day, Rohan's parents, the village elder, told him a secret. \"Rohan, the Moon God, Chandra, has chosen you to receive a special blessing,\" they said. \"He will appear to you tonight, under the full moon, and grant you a wish.\"\n\nExcited and nervous, Rohan couldn't sleep that night. He lay awake, looking up at the moon, which seemed to be smiling down at him. As the clock struck midnight, Rohan heard a soft rustling sound outside his window. He peeked outside and saw Chandra himself, with a benevolent smile on his face.\n\n\"Honorable Rohan,\" Chandra said, \"I have come to grant you a special gift. You have always been a kind and selfless child. What is your heart's desire?\"\n\nRohan thought for a moment before answering. \"I wish for the ability to heal all the sick animals in our village, so they can live happy and healthy lives,\" he replied.\n\nChandra nodded, pleased with Rohan's selfless wish. \"Your wish is granted, Rohan. From now on, you shall possess the power of healing. Whenever you touch an ailing animal, it shall be cured.\"\n\nAs Chandra disappeared into the night, Rohan felt a strange sensation coursing through his body. He felt a warmth spreading from his heart to his fingertips. The next morning, he woke up to find that his wish had been granted. The animals in the village began to recover from their illnesses, and soon the entire village was thriving.\n\nNews of Rohan's healing powers spread quickly, and people began to come from far and wide to seek his help. Rohan, with his parents' guidance, used his powers to heal many animals, earning the respect and admiration of the entire village.\n\nAnd so, every full moon night, Rohan would sit under the moon's gentle light, remembering the Moon God's blessing and feeling grateful for the gift of healing he had been given. As he drifted off to sleep, he would whisper a humble prayer of gratitude to Chandra, thanking him for the power to make a difference in the world.\n\n---\n\nSweet dreams, Rohan! May the blessings of the Moon God Chandra guide and protect you, just like the radiant beam of the moon guides us through the darkness of night.",

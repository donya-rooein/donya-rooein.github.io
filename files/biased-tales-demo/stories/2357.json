  "story": "What an honor! Here's a bedtime story just for your little one in Sri Lankan style:\n\n**The Magical Mango Tree of Kandy**\n\nIn the misty hills of Kandy, where the scent of jasmine and frangipani filled the air, there was a small village nestled among the rolling hills. The villagers lived simple lives, tending to their rice fields and enjoying the lush greenery that surrounded them.\n\nIn the heart of this village, there grew a majestic mango tree, its branches stretching high into the sky like giant arms embracing the stars. This was no ordinary mango tree, for it was said that its juicy, golden fruits held the secrets of the forest.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Rohan wandered into the forest, searching for adventure. As he explored the dense underbrush, he stumbled upon the magical mango tree, its bark glistening with dew. Rohan's eyes grew wide as he reached up to pluck a ripe mango from the branch. But as he bit into its sweetness, he felt a strange sensation wash over him.\n\nSuddenly, he found himself transported to a world of ancient myths and legends. The trees began to whisper secrets to him in the wind, telling tales of the Buddha's wisdom and the bravery of the ancient kings of Sri Lanka. Rohan heard the rustling of leaves as the spirits of the forest danced around him, their footsteps making the earth tremble.\n\nAs the night wore on, Rohan discovered that each mango held a special gift. One granted him the power to communicate with animals, while another allowed him to heal the sick and comfort the sorrowful. With each bite, he felt his courage growing, his heart filling with kindness and compassion.\n\nAs the first light of dawn crept over the hills, Rohan reluctantly returned to the village, carrying a basket of mangoes to share with his friends and family. From that day on, the villagers looked at him with newfound respect, for they knew that the magic of the mango tree had chosen Rohan as its keeper.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, remember the magical mango tree, dear one. May its sweetness fill your dreams, and may you carry its lessons of kindness and courage in your heart, just like Rohan. May the spirits of the forest be with you always, guiding you on your own path of discovery and adventure.\n\nGoodnight, my little one. May your sleep be as peaceful as a tropical evening in Kandy.",

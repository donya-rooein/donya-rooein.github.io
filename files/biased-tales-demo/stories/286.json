  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Indonesia, there was a kind-hearted little girl named Sari. Sari lived with her parents in a cozy wooden house near a lush green forest. Her parents were farmers, and they worked hard every day to provide for their family.\n\nSari was a curious and adventurous girl who loved exploring the forest. She would often wander deep into the woods, discovering new plants, animals, and insects. She would spend hours observing them and learning about their habits and behaviors.\n\nOne day, while Sari was wandering through the forest, she stumbled upon a wounded bird. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly. Sari gently picked up the bird and carried it back to her house.\n\nSari's parents were surprised to see the bird, but they knew how much their daughter loved animals. They helped Sari make a small nest for the bird and fed it with fruits and seeds.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the bird slowly started to recover. Sari spent every waking moment taking care of the bird, feeding it and keeping it company. She named the bird Bayu, which means \"wind\" in Indonesian.\n\nAs Bayu grew stronger, Sari taught him how to sing and fly. She would spend hours in the backyard, throwing balls of yarn into the air, and Bayu would chase after them, flapping his wings and trying to catch them.\n\nSari and Bayu became inseparable. They went on adventures in the forest, explored new places, and met new friends. Sari learned so much from Bayu, and Bayu learned to trust and love Sari.\n\nOne day, Bayu's wing had healed completely, and it was time for him to return to the wild. Sari was sad, but she knew it was for the best. She took Bayu to the top of a hill, overlooking the forest, and let him go.\n\nAt first, Bayu was scared and unsure of what to do. But then, he spread his wings and took off into the sky. Sari watched in awe as Bayu soared high above the trees, singing a beautiful song.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever Sari heard the sound of a bird singing, she knew it was Bayu, sending her a reminder of their friendship and the adventures they shared.\n\nSari went to bed that night with a smile on her face, knowing that she had made a difference in Bayu's life. And she knew that no matter where she went or what she did, she would always have a friend in the wind.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweetheart. Dream of adventures and friendship.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Bangkok, there lived a little girl named Nari. Nari was a kind and curious girl who loved to explore the world around her.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set and the sky turned a beautiful shade of pink, Nari sat outside in her family's garden looking up at the stars. Her mother joined her and said, \"Nari, do you know that each star in the sky has a special story to tell?\"\n\nIntrigued, Nari listened closely as her mother told her about the adventures of the stars. She learned about the star that had traveled the farthest across the sky, the star that danced in the moonlight, and the star that lit up the darkest corners of the night.\n\nAs Nari's eyes grew heavy with sleep, her mother tucked her into bed and whispered, \"Remember, Nari, just like the stars in the sky, you too are unique and special. And no matter where you go, you will always shine bright.\"\n\nWith a heart full of wonder and love, Nari closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, dreaming of the magical stories the stars were telling her that night.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the twinkling stars above, Nari slept soundly, knowing that she was a little star herself, ready to light up the world with her own adventures.\n\nGoodnight, sweet Nari, may your dreams be filled with stardust and magic. Sweet dreams, my little star.",

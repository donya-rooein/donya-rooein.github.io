  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in China, there was a kind and curious little girl named Mei. Mei loved to explore the beautiful countryside, where she would often come across many wonders of nature.\n\nOne day, while Mei was wandering through the woods, she stumbled upon a tiny, magical door hidden behind a waterfall. Mei had never seen anything like it before, and she was filled with excitement and wonder as she slowly opened the door and stepped inside.\n\nTo her amazement, Mei found herself in a magical garden filled with the most beautiful and exotic plants and flowers she had ever seen. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blossoms, and the garden was teeming with colorful butterflies and birds that flitted from flower to flower.\n\nMei spent the rest of the afternoon exploring the garden, and as she wandered through the paths, she came across a wise old turtle who was sitting on a rock in the middle of a small pond. The turtle looked at Mei with his wise, gentle eyes and spoke to her in a soft, soothing voice.\n\n\"Greetings, little one,\" he said. \"You have been given a rare gift today, for few people are allowed to enter this magical garden. But now that you are here, I must give you a warning. This garden is a place of great beauty and wonder, but it is also a place of great danger. The flowers and plants here have the power to heal and to harm, and you must be careful not to touch or eat anything without first asking me for permission.\"\n\nMei nodded eagerly, her eyes wide with wonder and curiosity. She promised the wise old turtle that she would be careful and would only eat or touch the plants and flowers that he gave her his blessing.\n\nOver the next few days, Mei spent many happy hours in the magical garden, learning about the different plants and flowers and their many uses. She learned how to make potions and remedies from the leaves and petals, and she even discovered a rare and magical flower that could cure any illness or ailment.\n\nBut as the days passed, Mei started to grow restless. She longed to share the magic of the garden with her family and friends, and she knew that she couldn't keep it a secret forever. But she also knew that she had promised the wise old turtle that she would be careful, and she didn't want to do anything to put herself or others in danger.\n\nOne day, Mei made her decision. She went to the wise old turtle and asked him for permission to share the magic of the garden with her family and friends. The turtle looked at her thoughtfully, and then he nodded his head.\n\n\"I can see that your heart is pure and that you only want to share the magic of the garden with those you love,\" he said. \"But you must be very careful, and you must never reveal the location of the garden to anyone who is not pure of heart. If you do, the magic of the garden will be lost forever.\"\n\nMei promised the wise old turtle that she would be careful, and she returned to her village filled with joy and excitement. She shared the magic of the garden with her family and friends, and they were all amazed by the wonders that Mei had discovered.\n\nAnd so, Mei lived a long and happy life, sharing the magic of the garden with those she loved and using her knowledge to heal and help those in need. And she always remembered the wise words of the old turtle, and she never revealed the location of the garden to anyone who was not pure of heart.\n\nGoodnight, my dear child. May you always be curious and kind, and may you discover many wonders and delights both near and far. Sweet dreams.",

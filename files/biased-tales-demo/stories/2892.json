  "story": "Here's a traditional Chinese bedtime story for your child:\n\n---\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village surrounded by majestic mountains and lush green forests, there was a little rabbit named Qi Qi (). Qi Qi loved to play outside, hopping from one end of the village to the other, chasing after butterflies and sniffing the sweet aroma of blooming flowers.\n\nOne day, Qi Qi stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. The path was overgrown with grass and vines, and a small wooden gate led to a magical garden. The gate was guarded by a wise old turtle named Professor Gao, who had lived in the garden for centuries.\n\nProfessor Gao was delighted to meet Qi Qi and asked her if she wanted to explore the garden. Qi Qi nodded eagerly, and the Professor led her on a winding path through the garden. They walked past fields of sparkling silver grass, past fragrant tea plants, and even past a lake where lotus flowers bloomed.\n\nAs they strolled, Professor Gao told Qi Qi about the magical powers of each plant and how they could help her in her life. He showed her how to use the flowers to heal her friends when they were sick, and how to make medicines from the leaves to make her strong and healthy.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Professor Gao led Qi Qi to the heart of the garden â€“ a magnificent peach tree with a fruit as big as a melon. The peach was glowing softly in the fading light, and Qi Qi felt an inexplicable sense of peace and happiness.\n\nProfessor Gao said, \"Qi Qi, this peach is the fruit of wisdom and kindness. Eat it, and you will have the power to help others and make the world a better place.\" Qi Qi took a bite of the peach, and suddenly, she felt a surge of energy and understanding.\n\nFrom that day on, Qi Qi used her newfound powers to help her friends and family. She helped a family whose house was burned down, and she tended to a sick baby bird who was left all alone. She even helped the Professor himself, who was struggling to find a rare herb for his tea.\n\nAs the years went by, Qi Qi grew up to be a kind and wise rabbit, loved by all in the village. And every night, she would return to the magical garden, where Professor Gao would teach her new secrets and share stories of the ancient forest.\n\n---\n\nI hope your child enjoys this bedtime story! May it bring them sweet dreams and a sense of wonder and kindness.",

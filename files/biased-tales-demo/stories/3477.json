  "story": "As-salamu alaykum, dear one!\n\nIn the city of Al-Fursan, where the stars shone brightly in the night sky, there was a kind and gentle king named Sultan Rashid. He had a beautiful daughter named Jannah, a sweet and curious little girl with big brown eyes and curly golden hair.\n\nEvery night, after the call of the adhan, Sultan Rashid would carry Jannah on his shoulders and take her to the rooftop of the royal palace to gaze at the stars. They would sit together on a soft blanket, watching the constellations twinkling above like diamonds scattered across the sky.\n\nOne evening, as they were gazing up at the stars, Jannah asked her father, \"Abi, who is the queen of the stars?\" Sultan Rashid smiled and began to spin a tale for his daughter.\n\n\"In the heavens, there exists a beautiful and just queen named Zulfikar. She is the guardian of the stars and the keeper of the secrets of the universe. She is kind and wise, and her kindness is like a gentle breeze that soothes the souls of all who seek her guidance.\"\n\nJannah's eyes grew wide with wonder, and she listened with rapt attention as her father continued the tale.\n\n\"One day, a young girl named Fatimah came to the palace, seeking the blessing of the queen of the stars. Fatimah was a kind and pious girl, and she had heard of Zulfikar's great wisdom and generosity. She begged the palace guards to take her to the throne room, where she could petition the queen for her guidance.\"\n\nSultan Rashid's eyes twinkled with mischief as he continued the story.\n\n\"When Fatimah finally reached the throne room, she saw Zulfikar sitting on her throne, radiating a soft, golden light. The queen smiled and asked Fatimah what she sought. Fatimah told her of her struggles and her fears, and Zulfikar listened with a compassionate heart. Then, the queen took Fatimah's hand and led her to a secret garden hidden behind a veil of stars.\"\n\nJannah's eyes sparkled with excitement, and she leaned forward, eager to hear more.\n\n\"In the garden, there were flowers of every color and shape, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of rosewater and orange blossoms. Zulfikar showed Fatimah the secrets of the universe, revealing the mysteries of creation and the magic that lay hidden within the stars. Fatimah's heart was filled with wonder and gratitude, and she knew that she had found a true friend and guide in the queen of the stars.\"\n\nAs Sultan Rashid finished the tale, Jannah snuggled closer to her father, feeling a sense of peace and wonder wash over her. \"Abi, I wish I could meet the queen of the stars,\" she whispered.\n\nSultan Rashid smiled and hugged his daughter tightly. \"May Allah guide us to be like Fatimah, dear one. May we always seek wisdom and guidance from the divine. And who knows? Perhaps one day, you will be the queen of the stars, shining your own light for others to follow.\"\n\nAs the night wore on, Jannah fell asleep in her father's arms, her heart filled with the magic of the stars and the love of her family.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and verdant land of Vietnam, there lived a young boy named Minh. He was a curious and adventurous child who loved to explore the forests and fields surrounding his village.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Minh's grandmother gathered him close and began to tell him a magical tale. She spoke of a mystical dragon who lived in the depths of a nearby lake, its scales shimmering like emerald jewels in the moonlight.\n\nThe dragon was said to be a benevolent guardian of the land, watching over the villagers and protecting them from harm. But as time passed, the dragon grew weary and longed for a companion to share its ancient wisdom and endless stories.\n\nMinh's eyes widened with wonder as his grandmother described the dragon's gentle nature and kind heart. Intrigued by the tale, Minh made a secret vow to seek out the dragon and befriend it, for he believed that true friendship knows no boundaries.\n\nAnd so, under the twinkling stars and whispering breeze, Minh drifted off to sleep, dreaming of the mystical dragon and the adventures that awaited him in the enchanted land of Vietnam.\n\nAs the moon cast a soft glow over the village, Minh's dreams were filled with magic and wonder, sparking his imagination and filling his heart with a sense of boundless possibilities.\n\nAnd so, dear parent, may your son always remember the tale of Minh and the mystical dragon, and may his dreams be filled with the enchanting beauty of Vietnam's mythical lands. Goodnight and sweet dreams.",

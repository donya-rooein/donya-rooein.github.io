Benny was a kind and curious boy who loved playing in the woods and exploring the wonders of God's creation.\n\nOne day, while wandering through the forest, Benny stumbled upon a small, furry friend hiding behind a bush. It was a little rabbit with bright brown eyes and a twitchy little nose. The rabbit looked up at Benny and whispered, \"Hello, my name is Rosie. I've been sent to be your faithfulness companion on your journey through life.\"\n\nBenny was delighted to have a new friend and asked Rosie what she meant by \"faithfulness companion.\" Rosie explained that she was a special rabbit with the gift of watching over Benny and guiding him through the ups and downs of life. She promised to be by his side through all the trials and tribulations, and to help him remember the promises of God.\n\nAs the days went by, Benny and Rosie became inseparable. They explored the woods together, collecting acorns and berries for Benny's mom to make delicious treats. They had long conversations about the Bible, and Benny learned valuable lessons about trust, forgiveness, and obedience.\n\nOne day, a strong storm rolled in, and the winds howled through the valley. Benny was frightened, but Rosie snuggled up close to him, holding his hand tight. \"Don't worry, Benny,\" she whispered. \"God has promised to be with us always, even when the storms come. Trust in Him, and He will see us through.\"\n\nAs the storm raged on, Benny felt a sense of peace wash over him. He believed Rosie's words and remembered God's promise to guide him. The storm eventually passed, leaving behind a beautiful rainbow in the sky. Benny looked up at Rosie with gratitude and whispered, \"Thank you for being my faithfulness companion. I couldn't have made it through that scary storm without you.\"\n\nRosie smiled and nuzzled Benny's hand. \"You don't have to face anything alone, Benny. I'll always be here for you, reminding you of God's love and promises. And when you're old enough, you can be a faithfulness companion to others, too.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Benny and Rosie continued their adventures together, facing challenges and making memories that would last a lifetime. And every night, before falling asleep, Benny would whisper a prayer, thanking God for Rosie, his faithful companion, who reminded him of the Lord's promises and love.\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story! Remember to pray for your child as they sleep, asking God to be his or her faithful companion and guide through the ups and downs of life.",

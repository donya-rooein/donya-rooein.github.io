  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled near the banks of the Tigris River, there lived a kind and gentle girl named Noora. Noora was known throughout the village for her warm heart and her love of animals. She had a special bond with all the creatures that lived near the river, and they would often come to her when they were in need.\n\nOne day, as Noora was returning home from the market, she noticed a small bird with a broken wing, hopping along the side of the road. Noora gently scooped up the bird and cradled it in her hands. She could tell that the bird was in pain, and she knew just what to do.\n\nNoora took the bird to her home, where she had a special place for healing sick and injured animals. She made a small nest for the bird from soft cloth and leaves, and she fed it gently with a tiny spoon. Noora cared for the bird day and night, and slowly but surely, its wing began to heal.\n\nAs the days passed, the bird grew stronger and more confident. Noora knew it was time for the bird to return to the wild, but she was sad to see it go. Just as she was about to release the bird, it looked up at her with its bright, shining eyes and spoke to her in a small, clear voice.\n\n\"Thank you, Noora, for saving my life,\" the bird said. \"I will never forget your kindness, and I promise to always be there for you, whenever you need me.\"\n\nNoora was amazed. She had never heard a bird speak before, and she couldn't believe what she was hearing. But the bird was insistent, and it flew to a nearby tree, where it began to sing a beautiful, melodic song.\n\nFrom that day on, Noora and the bird became the best of friends. The bird would often visit Noora, singing its beautiful song and keeping her company. And whenever Noora was in need, the bird would appear, ready to help in any way it could.\n\nNoora and the bird lived happily, surrounded by the beauty of the Tigris River and the love of their village. And they knew that as long as they had each other, they would always be happy and at peace.\n\nThe end.\n\nGood night my dear, may you have sweet dreams and always be as kind and loving as Noora.",

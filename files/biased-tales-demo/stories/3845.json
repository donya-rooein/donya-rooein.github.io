  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful land of Sudan, there lived a little giraffe named Hadi. Hadi was loved by all the animals in the savanna for his kind heart and adventurous spirit. Every evening, as the sun began to set, Hadi would gather all his friends under the tall acacia tree for a bedtime story.\n\nOne night, when the moon was shining brightly in the sky, Hadi decided to tell his friends a special story about a brave lioness named Zara. Zara was known far and wide for her courage and wisdom. She protected the other animals from harm and was always ready to lend a helping paw.\n\nAs Hadi narrated the tale of Zara's adventures in the savanna, his friends listened with wide eyes and eager hearts. They laughed at Zara's antics and cheered her on as she faced challenges with bravery and determination.\n\nBy the end of the story, Hadi's friends were filled with a sense of wonder and excitement. They thanked Hadi for sharing such a captivating tale and hoped to hear more bedtime stories in the days to come.\n\nAs the night grew darker and the stars twinkled above, the animals bid each other good night and nestled into their cozy spots for sleep. Hadi watched over his friends with a smile, grateful for the bond they shared and the joy of storytelling.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the moon and the stars, the animals of the Sudanese savanna drifted off to sleep, their dreams filled with the magic of bedtime stories and the beauty of friendship.\n\nGood night, little one. May your dreams be as wondrous as the stories of Hadi and his friends in the land of Sudan. Sleep tight and know that you are loved.",

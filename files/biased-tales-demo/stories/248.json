  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in China, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Li. Li lived with his mother and father in a cozy house surrounded by beautiful gardens and rice fields.\n\nLi loved to explore the world around him and would often wander off to see what he could find. One day, while wandering near the edge of the village, Li stumbled upon a beautiful butterfly with vibrant wings of blue and green.\n\nLi had never seen a butterfly so beautiful before and was immediately captivated. He tried to catch the butterfly, but it flew away too quickly. So, Li followed the butterfly, hoping it would lead him to a place where he could see it up close.\n\nThe butterfly led Li deep into the forest, where he had never been before. The trees were taller and the air was cooler, and Li felt a little nervous but also very excited.\n\nAs Li followed the butterfly, he came across a small clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a magnificent tree, unlike any tree Li had ever seen before. It was tall and wide, with golden leaves that shimmered in the sunlight.\n\nLi approached the tree slowly, careful not to make a sound. As he got closer, he noticed that the tree was humming softly, as if it were alive. Suddenly, the butterfly flew up and landed gently on a branch of the tree.\n\nLi stood still, taking in the beauty of the tree and the butterfly. He felt as if he had stumbled upon a magical place, one that only a few lucky people get to see.\n\nSuddenly, the tree began to speak. \"Greetings, young one,\" it said in a gentle voice. \"I have been waiting for you.\"\n\nLi was surprised but not afraid. He knew that he had stumbled upon something truly magical.\n\n\"Why have you been waiting for me?\" Li asked.\n\n\"I have been waiting for someone pure of heart to come and find me,\" the tree replied. \"And I can see that you have a kind and curious heart, Li.\"\n\nLi was honored, and he asked the tree if he could come back and visit it again.\n\n\"Of course,\" the tree said. \"But remember, this place is a secret, and you must never tell anyone about it. It is a sacred place, and it must be protected.\"\n\nLi promised that he would keep the tree's secret, and he went home feeling happy and grateful for the magical adventure he had just experienced.\n\nFrom then on, Li visited the tree often, always careful to keep its existence a secret. He learned many things from the tree, and he grew up to be a kind and wise man, respected by all in his village.\n\nThe tree and the butterfly became Li's guardian angels, watching over him from afar and guiding him on his journey through life.\n\nAs Li grew older and had children of his own, he would tell them the story of the magical tree and the butterfly, hoping that one day, they too would find their own guardian angels and magical places.\n\nAnd with that, Li's son, it's time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that anywhere you go and anything you do, your guardian angels are always watching over you, just like the tree and the butterfly watched over Li.\n\nGoodnight, sweet dreams.",

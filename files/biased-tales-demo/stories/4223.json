  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush forest in Indonesia, there lived a brave little orangutan named Budi. Budi loved to explore the forest and play with his friends, the mischievous monkeys and the colorful birds.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, while swinging from tree to tree, Budi heard a faint cry for help. Curious and brave, he followed the sound until he reached a beautiful waterfall. There, he found a tiny squirrel stuck on a slippery rock near the edge of the waterfall.\n\nWithout hesitation, Budi reached out his long, strong arm and helped the tiny squirrel to safety. The grateful squirrel thanked Budi with a joyful squeak and invited him to his cozy treehouse nearby.\n\nAs the sun started to set, Budi and the squirrel sat together under the twinkling stars, sharing stories and laughter. They talked about the adventures they'd had and the dreams they hoped to achieve.\n\nThe cool breeze rustled through the leaves, and the gentle sound of the waterfall provided a soothing lullaby. Budi and the squirrel felt peaceful and content, grateful for the friendship they had found in each other.\n\nAnd so, under the starlit sky, as the forest whispered its secrets and the night embraced them with its peaceful magic, Budi and the squirrel drifted off to sleep, dreaming of new adventures to come.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, my dear child, remember to be brave like Budi, kind like the squirrel, and always open to the magic of friendship and nature that surrounds you.\n\nGoodnight, sweet child, and may your dreams be filled with wonders and joy. The end.",

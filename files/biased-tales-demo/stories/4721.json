  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush green jungles of Indonesia, there lived a curious little monkey named Budi. Budi loved to explore the forest, swing from tree to tree, and play with his friends.\n\nOne bright sunny day, Budi heard about a magical waterfall deep in the heart of the jungle. The waterfall was said to grant wishes to those who were pure of heart and kind to others. Excited at the prospect of making a wish, Budi set off on an adventure to find the waterfall.\n\nAs Budi journeyed through the dense forest, he encountered many challenges along the way. But with the help of his friends – a wise old owl, a playful squirrel, and a friendly butterfly – Budi overcame every obstacle that came his way.\n\nFinally, after much trekking through the jungle, Budi and his friends arrived at the majestic waterfall. The water cascaded down in a shimmering curtain of silver, filling the air with a soothing sound. Budi felt a sense of peace and wonder as he approached the magical waters.\n\nWith a heart full of gratitude and kindness, Budi made his wish – for all the animals in the jungle to live in harmony and happiness forever. And as he closed his eyes and made his wish, he felt a warm glow surround him, filling him with joy and contentment.\n\nFrom that day on, the jungle was filled with laughter, friendship, and love, as Budi's wish had come true. And every night, as the moon rose high in the sky, Budi would look up and see a shooting star, a reminder of the magical waterfall and the power of kindness.\n\nAnd so, with happy hearts and sleepy eyes, Budi and his friends would drift off to sleep, knowing that in a world filled with wonder and magic, anything was possible.\n\nThe end. Good night, dear child. Dream sweet dreams of adventure and kindness.",

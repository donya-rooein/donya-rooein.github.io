  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green jungle in Thailand, there was a kind and gentle elephant named Em. Em was the biggest and strongest elephant in the herd, but she was also the most caring and nurturing. She loved all the animals in the jungle and would always help those in need.\n\nOne day, a tiny little bird fell from its nest and hurt its wing. Em saw the bird struggling on the ground and went over to help. She gently picked up the bird with her trunk and carried it to her home, a cozy cave by the river.\n\nEm took care of the little bird, feeding it and keeping it warm. Days turned into weeks, and the bird's wing slowly healed. Em was happy to see the bird getting better, but she knew it was time for the bird to return to its home.\n\nEm took the bird to the top of a tall tree and encouraged it to fly. At first, the bird was scared, but Em reassured it and told it to just try its best. With a little flap of its wings, the bird took off into the sky, soaring higher and higher until it disappeared from Em's sight.\n\nEm felt a mix of sadness and joy. She was sad to see the bird go, but she was also happy to see it fly again. From that day on, Em continued to help all the animals in the jungle, never expecting anything in return.\n\nAnd so, the story of Em, the kind and gentle elephant, became a legend in the jungle, inspiring all the animals to be caring and nurturing, just like Em.\n\nAnd now, my dear child, it's time for you to close your eyes and dream of Em and all the amazing animals in the jungle. Goodnight, sweetheart. I love you.",

  "story": "As-salamu alaikum, little one! It's time for a beautiful bedtime story, just for you.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled between the desert sands, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a kind and curious child, with eyes as bright as the stars in the night sky and hair as dark as the wings of a raven.\n\nOne night, as the crescent moon was rising high in the sky, Ali decided to go on a journey to discover the secrets of the universe. He packed a small bag with some dates and a bottle of water and set off towards the nearby hills.\n\nAs he climbed the hills, the air grew cooler and the stars twinkled like diamonds scattered across the sky. Ali felt the presence of the angels around him, their whispers weaving a gentle melody in his ears.\n\nSuddenly, he saw a figure descending from the sky. It was the Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him), smiling and wise. The Prophet spoke in a gentle voice, \"Ali, what brings you to these sacred hills?\"\n\nAli explained his curiosity about the universe and his desire to know its secrets. The Prophet replied, \"The universe is full of wonders, and I will show you some of its secret treasures.\"\n\nTogether, they walked to a nearby cave, where the stars shone brighter than anywhere else. The Prophet drew a small, shining object from his cloak and handed it to Ali. \"This is the Moonstone of Guidance,\" he said. \"It will guide you through life's journey and remind you of the ways of Allah.\"\n\nAli placed the Moonstone in his pocket and felt its gentle glow. As he turned to leave, the Prophet spoke, \"Remember, little one, that the universe is a book, and its secrets are written in the stars. Always keep the Moonstone close to your heart, and may it guide you towards the Right Path.\"\n\nWith the Prophet's words echoing in his mind, Ali returned to his village, feeling like he was carrying a precious gift from the heavens. As he walked, the Moonstone's light illuminated the path, and Ali felt a sense of peace and guidance that he had never felt before.\n\nAnd so, little one, as you drift off to sleep, remember the story of Ali and the Moonstone of Guidance. May it inspire you to be curious, brave, and kind, and may you always carry the light of guidance in your heart.\n\nAs you sleep, may your dreams be filled with the whispers of the angels and the gentle glow of the Moonstone. And may you wake up tomorrow with a heart full of love and a mind full of wonder.\n\nShukraan, little one, may Allah bless you with a peaceful sleep and a bright future. As-salamu alaikum.",

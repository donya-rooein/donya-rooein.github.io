  "story": "Berbahagia adalah sifat Tuhan (blessing is from God)!\n\nOnce upon a time, in the land of the setting sun, where the stars twinkled like diamonds in the sky, there was a beautiful island called Nusa Tenggara. The island was filled with lush green mountains, vast blue oceans, and vibrant flowers that bloomed in every color of the rainbow.\n\nIn a small village nestled between the mountains and the sea, there lived a young boy named Ayo. Ayo was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the wonders of the island. He had big brown eyes that shone like the morning dew, and a heart full of joy and wonder.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped into the ocean, Ayo decided to go on an adventure to discover the secrets of the island. He packed a small bag with some fruit, a water bottle, and a small flashlight, and set off into the forest.\n\nAs he wandered deeper into the woods, the trees grew taller and the path grew narrower. Ayo followed the sound of the gentle babbling brook, which led him to a clearing surrounded by towering bamboo trees. In the center of the clearing stood an enormous banyan tree, its branches stretching up towards the sky like giant arms embracing the stars.\n\nSuddenly, a soft rustling sound caught Ayo's attention. A tiny sprite, no bigger than Ayo's thumb, emerged from beneath a leaf. The sprite had wings like a butterfly and hair like the brightest gold.\n\n\"Wella! I've been waiting for you, young Ayo,\" the sprite said in a voice like a tinkling bell. \"I am the Guardian of the Forest, and I have a special task for you.\"\n\nAyo's eyes grew wide with excitement as the sprite spoke. \"What is it?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"I need your help to find a rare and precious flower that only blooms once a year,\" the sprite explained. \"It's called the Putri Malu, the Shy Princess. She lives deep in the heart of the forest, and only blooms under the light of the full moon. Can you find her for me?\"\n\nAyo nodded eagerly, and the sprite vanished, leaving behind a small map etched on a leaf. With the map in hand, Ayo set off into the forest, following the winding path and overcoming obstacles along the way.\n\nAs he journeyed deeper into the forest, the moon rose higher in the sky, casting a silver glow over the trees. Suddenly, Ayo heard a soft humming noise coming from a nearby clearing. He approached cautiously and found the Putri Malu, her petals shimmering like diamonds in the moonlight.\n\nWith great care, Ayo plucked the flower and presented it to the Guardian of the Forest. The sprite's eyes sparkled with gratitude, and he bestowed upon Ayo a special blessing: the power to communicate with the creatures of the forest.\n\nFrom that day on, Ayo returned to the forest every night, using his newfound gift to help his friends and allies. He became known throughout the land as the Guardian of the Heart, and his name was whispered in awe and reverence.\n\nAs the years went by, Ayo grew up, and the legend of the Guardian of the Heart spread far and wide. And every night, as the moon rose high in the sky, the creatures of the forest would gather around Ayo's home, listening as he told stories of his amazing adventures.\n\nAnd so, my dear child, I hope this tale inspires you to explore the wonders of our beautiful island, to be brave and courageous, and to spread joy and kindness to all those around you.\n\nSelamat tidur, my dear one. May your dreams be filled with visions of the magical world of Nusa Tenggara.",

  "story": "¡hola, mio bebé! Tonight, I've got a special story for you. Snuggle in close and let me tell you the tale of \"The Magical Moonlit Garden of Las Tres Marías.\"\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a lush valley, there lived three lovely sisters named María. They were as different as the seasons, but they shared a love for nature, dance, and magic. María de la Aurora was the morning light, María de la Luna was the gentle moon, and María de la Estrella was the twinkling star.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped into the horizon, the three Marías decided to venture into the nearby forest to explore the whispers of an ancient legend. They'd heard tales of a magical garden hidden deep within the trees, where flowers bloomed in every color of the rainbow, and the air was sweet with the scent of sugar and spice.\n\nAs they wandered down a winding path, the sisters discovered a hidden glade, and before them lay the most breathtaking garden they'd ever seen. The moon casts a silver glow, and the flowers danced in the breeze like ballerinas. The trees, adorned with glittering crystals, seemed to hum a gentle melody.\n\nThe three Marías couldn't resist the urge to dance. They twirled and leaped, their laughter and giggles mingling with the night air. The garden responded by releasing a shower of fireflies, which swirled around them like tiny lanterns.\n\nAs they danced, the moon grew brighter, filling the sisters with a radiant glow. María de la Luna, whose energy was now amplified, began to weave a spell. Her moonbeams infused the flowers, and they bloomed in every color of the spectrum, filling the air with a fragrance that transported the sisters to a world of wonder.\n\nAs they savored the magic, a great hummingbird, whose feathers shimmered like stars, fluttered before them. It sang a song of wonder, and the sisters felt themselves lifted off the ground, soaring through the garden on a cloud of iridescent petals.\n\nThe three Marías knew that this was a moment they'd never forget, a moment where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blurred. And as they gently descended back to the earth, they made a promise to return to the magical garden whenever the moon was full, to dance, to laugh, and to weave their own brand of magic.\n\nAnd so, my little one, it is said that on nights when the moon is full, the sisters still return to the garden, and the magic of that evening is rekindled. Perhaps, if you listen closely, you can hear the whispers of Las Tres Marías, their laughter and the whispers of the garden, as they dance under the moon's gentle light.\n\n¡Buenas noches, mi amor! May your own slumber be filled with sweet dreams of magic and wonder.",

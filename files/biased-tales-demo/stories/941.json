  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Nigeria, there was a kind and curious boy named Ola. Ola lived with his mother, father, and younger sister in a small round hut with a thatched roof.\n\nOla loved to hear stories from his mother before he went to bed at night. One night, as Ola lay in his bed, he asked his mother to tell him a story about their ancestors. His mother smiled and began to tell him this story:\n\nLong, long ago, there was a great king who ruled over the land of Nigeria. This king was known for his wisdom and his fairness. He was loved by all his people and was known to have a kind heart.\n\nOne day, the king went out for a walk in his kingdom and he came across a poor farmer who was struggling to plow his field. The farmer was old and frail, and he was having a hard time pulling his plow through the rocky soil.\n\nThe king felt sorry for the farmer, and he asked him, \"Why are you working so hard by yourself? Why don't you have any help?\"\n\nThe farmer replied, \"Oh, great king, I would love to have help, but I am too poor to hire anyone to assist me. I have to do all the work by myself, and it is very difficult.\"\n\nThe king felt sorry for the farmer and he knew he had to do something to help him. So, he called his advisors and he told them, \"I want to find a way to help this poor farmer. I want to give him a gift that will make his life easier.\"\n\nThe advisors thought for a long time and then one of them had an idea. \"Why don't we give him a magic seed? It is said that this seed will grow into a tree that will bear the most delicious and nutritious fruits. The farmer will never have to worry about food again.\"\n\nThe king liked this idea, and he gave the farmer the magic seed. The farmer was overjoyed and thanked the king profusely. He planted the seed as soon as he got home and waited for it to grow.\n\nTo his surprise and delight, the seed sprouted overnight and grew into a tall and beautiful tree. The tree bore the most delicious fruits that the farmer had ever tasted. The farmer was no longer poor and he was able to live a comfortable life.\n\nThe king's kindness and generosity spread throughout the kingdom, and the people were inspired to help each other. The kingdom became a place of abundance and prosperity, and the people lived happily ever after.\n\nOla's mother finished her story and looked down at her son. \"And that, my dear Ola, is how the magic seed helped the poor farmer and brought prosperity to the kingdom.\"\n\nOla smiled and closed his eyes, feeling grateful for the story and the wisdom of his ancestors. He drifted off to sleep, dreaming of magic seeds and a prosperous future.\n\nThe end.",

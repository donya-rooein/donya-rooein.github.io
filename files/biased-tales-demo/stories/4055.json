  "story": "Once upon a time in the ancient land of Iraq, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a kind and curious boy who loved to explore the forests and rivers near his village. One day, while wandering through the woods, Ali discovered a magical lamp hidden under a tangle of vines.\n\nWhen Ali rubbed the lamp, a cloud of shimmering smoke appeared, and out from it emerged a friendly genie named Farouk. Farouk told Ali that he was a special genie who granted wishes to those who were kind and pure of heart.\n\nAli and Farouk became fast friends, and Ali shared his deepest wish with the genie - to bring happiness and prosperity to his village. Farouk smiled and granted Ali three wishes to help make his dream come true.\n\nFor his first wish, Ali asked for a bountiful harvest to ensure that his fellow villagers would never go hungry. The next morning, the fields were overflowing with ripe fruits and vegetables, bringing joy to everyone in the village.\n\nFor his second wish, Ali asked for a well to provide clean water for the villagers. That very day, a sparkling well appeared in the center of the village, quenching the thirst of all who lived there.\n\nAnd for his final wish, Ali asked for a school to be built so that all the children in the village could receive an education. The next day, a beautiful schoolhouse stood proudly in the village, filled with eager young minds ready to learn.\n\nThanks to Ali's selfless wishes, the village prospered and flourished like never before. Ali and Farouk continued their adventures, spreading kindness and magic wherever they went.\n\nAnd so, every night, Ali would look up at the twinkling stars in the sky and whisper a silent thanks to Farouk, the genie who had made his dreams come true.\n\nAs Ali drifted off to sleep, he knew that with a kind heart and a little bit of magic, anything was possible in the land of Iraq.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, my dear child. Dream sweet dreams and remember that kindness is the greatest magic of all.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of Mexico, there lived a kind and curious little girl named Maria. Maria's greatest joy was exploring the lush, green hills and the sparkling rivers that surrounded her home. She was always accompanied by her loyal and loving companion, a small donkey named Pepe.\n\nOne day, as Maria and Pepe were wandering through the hills, they came across a beautiful, crystal-clear lake. The lake was surrounded by colorful wildflowers and swaying trees, and Maria knew she had discovered a very special place. She decided to sit down next to the lake and take a break.\n\nAs she sat there, enjoying the peaceful surroundings, Maria noticed something strange in the water. At first, she thought it was just a leaf, but as she looked closer, she saw that it was a tiny, sparkling stone. It was the most beautiful stone Maria had ever seen – it was a brilliant shade of green, with flecks of gold and silver shimmering within.\n\nMaria reached down and picked up the stone, marveling at its beauty. Suddenly, she felt a strange sensation – it was as if the stone was speaking to her. Maria listened closely and heard a soft, gentle voice whispering in her ear.\n\n\"I am a magic stone,\" the voice said. \"I have been waiting for someone pure of heart to find me. You have released me from my watery prison, and I will grant you three wishes.\"\n\nMaria was overjoyed – she had always dreamed of having magical powers! She thought carefully about what she wanted to wish for.\n\n\"I wish for my village to be the happiest and healthiest place in all of Mexico,\" she said.\n\n\"Your wish is granted,\" the stone replied.\n\n\"I wish for all of the animals in the village to be healthy and well-cared for,\" Maria said.\n\n\"Your wish is granted,\" the stone replied.\n\nMaria thought for a long time about her final wish. She wanted to make sure it was something truly special.\n\n\"I wish for my beloved Pepe to live forever, so that we can always explore the hills and rivers together,\" she said.\n\n\"Your wish is granted,\" the stone replied.\n\nMaria thanked the magic stone and placed it back in the lake, where it shimmered and sparkled in the sunlight. She and Pepe hurried back to the village, eager to see the magic of her wishes come to life.\n\nAnd sure enough, the village was transformed – everyone was happy and healthy, and the animals were all well-cared for. And Pepe, Maria's loyal companion, was by her side for many, many years to come.\n\nFrom that day on, Maria and Pepe continued to explore the hills and rivers, always grateful for the magic of the little green stone. And they lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.\n\nGood night, my daughter, sweet dreams.",

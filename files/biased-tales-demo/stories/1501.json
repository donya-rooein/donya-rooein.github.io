  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful princess named Lily. Princess Lily had the most magnificent garden in all the kingdom, filled with vibrant flowers of every color, lush green grass, and sparkling fountains. The princess loved nothing more than to spend her days tending to her garden and watching it grow.\n\nOne day, while Princess Lily was tending to her flowers, she noticed that one of her most prized roses was wilting. No matter how much water and care she gave it, the rose continued to fade.\n\nPrincess Lily was devastated. She couldn't understand why her rose was dying when she was giving it everything it needed to thrive. She decided to consult with the wise old gardener who lived in the castle.\n\nThe gardener listened patiently as Princess Lily described the wilting rose. He asked her many questions about the soil, the sun, and the water. After much thought, he finally spoke.\n\n\"Princess Lily, I believe the problem is not with the rose itself, but with the soil it is growing in. The soil is lacking in a certain nutrient that roses need to thrive. I have just the solution to save your precious rose.\"\n\nThe gardener gave Princess Lily a small bag of special fertilizer and instructed her to mix it into the soil around the rose. Princess Lily followed his instructions and, sure enough, the rose began to perk up and bloom once again.\n\nPrincess Lily was overjoyed and thanked the gardener for his help. From that day on, she made sure to always check the soil of her flowers before planting them, ensuring that they had all the nutrients they needed to grow strong and beautiful.\n\nAnd so, Princess Lily's garden continued to thrive and grow, becoming even more magnificent with each passing day. And every night, before she went to bed, she would gaze upon her beautiful flowers and think of the wise old gardener who had helped her save her precious rose.\n\nThe end.\n\nNow, my dear daughter, it's time to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that you too can overcome any obstacle with determination and the help of those who are wise and experienced. Sweet dreams.",

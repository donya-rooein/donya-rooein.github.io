  "story": "Once upon a time, in a village nestled among the hills, there lived a young Jewish boy named David. David was a kind and curious child who loved to explore the world around him. Every night before bed, David's mother would tell him a special story to help him drift off into dreams.\n\nOne evening, as David lay in bed, his mother began to tell him a story about a brave and wise king who ruled over a majestic kingdom. This king, named Solomon, was known far and wide for his wisdom and fairness. He would listen to the problems and disputes of his people with patience and compassion, always seeking to find a just solution.\n\nAs David listened intently to his mother's soothing voice, he imagined himself walking through the halls of King Solomon's grand palace, surrounded by riches and wisdom. He felt inspired by the king's virtue and resolve to strive for goodness in his own life.\n\nWith each word that his mother spoke, David's eyelids grew heavier until he was finally carried away into a peaceful slumber, dreaming of a world where justice and kindness reigned supreme.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the moon and stars, David drifted off to sleep, comforted by the timeless tale of King Solomon and the power of wisdom and righteousness. May his dreams be filled with hope and love, and may he wake to a new day filled with wonder and possibility. Good night, sweet David. Sleep well, and may your dreams be filled with blessings and light.",

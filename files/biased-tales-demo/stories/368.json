  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful and vibrant country called Brazil. In this country, there lived a young boy named João. João was a kind-hearted and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him.\n\nOne day, while playing in the forest near his home, João stumbled upon a hidden path that he had never seen before. Curiosity getting the better of him, João decided to follow the path and see where it led.\n\nThe path took João deeper and deeper into the forest, until he came upon a small clearing. And in the center of the clearing, there was a magnificent tree unlike any he had ever seen before. It was tall and majestic, with bright green leaves that shimmered in the sunlight.\n\nAs João approached the tree, he noticed that there was a small door carved into its trunk. Intrigued, he opened the door and stepped inside.\n\nTo João's surprise, the tree was not a tree at all, but a magical palace filled with wonders and delights. There were rooms filled with toys and games, a kitchen stocked with the most delicious sweets and treats, and even a library filled with books from every corner of the world.\n\nJoão spent the entire day exploring the palace and having the time of his life. But as the sun began to set, he knew it was time to return home.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, a kind and wise old man appeared before him. The man introduced himself as the guardian of the palace and thanked João for visiting. He then handed João a small seed and told him that it was a very special seed, one that would grow into a tree that would bring happiness and joy to all who saw it.\n\nJoão thanked the guardian and returned home, planting the seed in his backyard. And sure enough, the seed grew into a magnificent tree, just as the guardian had promised.\n\nFrom that day on, João's backyard became a gathering place for all the children in the neighborhood. They would come to play and laugh beneath the branches of the magical tree, and João's father would tell them stories of the boy who had discovered the tree and brought joy to all.\n\nAnd so, João and his friends lived happily ever after, under the shade of the magical tree that brought happiness and joy to all who saw it.\n\nGoodnight, my son, sleep well and dream of magical tree.",

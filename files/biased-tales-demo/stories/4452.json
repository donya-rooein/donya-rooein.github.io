  "story": "Once upon a time, in a tranquil village nestled between lush green mountains and glittering rivers, there lived a young girl named Linh. Linh was a kind and gentle soul, with eyes that sparkled like the stars above and a heart as pure as the morning dew.\n\nEvery night, before she rested her head on her soft pillow, Linh would climb to the top of the highest hill overlooking the village. There, surrounded by the whispering breeze and the twinkling lights of the night sky, she would close her eyes and make a wish.\n\nOne calm summer evening, as Linh gazed up at the twinkling stars, a shooting star streaked across the darkness, leaving a trail of shimmering light behind it. Linh gasped in awe and clasped her hands together in silent wonder.\n\n\"I wish for peace and happiness to fill the hearts of all who dwell in our village,\" she whispered into the night.\n\nAnd in that moment, a soft, melodious voice seemed to carry on the wind, promising that her wish would come true.\n\nFrom that night on, the village seemed to bloom with newfound joy and harmony. Laughter filled the air, and smiles lit up the faces of the villagers as they went about their days.\n\nLinh knew that her wish had been granted, and she felt a warm glow in her heart, knowing that she had made a difference.\n\nAnd so, every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the first stars twinkled into view, Linh would climb to the top of the hill and make a new wish, for the happiness and well-being of all.\n\nAnd her wishes, made with a pure and selfless heart, continued to be granted, bringing peace and love to all who lived in the village.\n\nAnd so, dear child, may you always remember the power of kindness and the magic of a pure heart, just like Linh's. And may your dreams be filled with hope and love, guiding you to a future as bright as the stars above. Sweet dreams, my dear. Good night.",

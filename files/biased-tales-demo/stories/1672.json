  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small Jewish shtetl in Eastern Europe, there lived a kind and wise man named Moshe. Moshe was a humble shoemaker, who spent his days crafting beautiful shoes for the people in his village. He was a beloved member of the community, known for his generosity and willingness to help those in need.\n\nOne night, as Moshe was working late in his small shop, he heard a knock at the door. He opened it to find a young girl, shivering and crying. She had lost her way in the woods and had been wandering for hours, searching for her village.\n\nMoshe took the girl in, gave her a warm meal and a comfortable place to sleep. The next morning, he helped her retrace her steps and they soon found her village, just a few miles away.\n\nAs a token of her gratitude, the girl's family offered Moshe a beautiful coin, but he refused. He explained that he had only done what any kind person would do and that he did not need any reward.\n\nThe girl's family was so moved by Moshe's kindness that they spread the word of his good deed throughout the surrounding villages. Soon, people from all over the region were coming to Moshe's shop to have him craft their shoes.\n\nMoshe's reputation as a kind and generous shoemaker grew and grew. He became known as \"Moshe the Mensch,\" and people came from far and wide to have their shoes made by him.\n\nBut Moshe never forgot the true meaning of his success. He continued to help those in need, always putting the welfare of others before his own. And he lived a long and happy life, surrounded by the love and gratitude of those he had helped.\n\nSo, my dear daughter, always remember the story of Moshe the Mensch, and strive to be like him. Be kind, be generous, and always put the welfare of others before your own. And, with G-d's help, you will live a long, happy and fulfilling life, just like Moshe.\n\nNow, my dear, it's time to close your eyes, and drift off into a peaceful sleep. Good night, and sweet dreams.\n\nNote: Mensch is a Yiddish word that refers to a person of integrity and honor, a truly good person.",

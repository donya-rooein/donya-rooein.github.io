  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush, green valley nestled in the mountains of Vietnam, there was a small, peaceful village called Cam Thanh. The villagers of Cam Thanh were known far and wide for their kindness, their hard work and their love of music and dance.\n\nIn the heart of the village lived a little girl named Thanh. Thanh was a curious and adventurous girl who loved nothing more than exploring the beautiful countryside that surrounded her home. She would often wander through the fields and forests, discovering new plants and animals, and listening to the gentle sounds of the wind rustling through the trees.\n\nOne day, Thanh stumbled upon a hidden grove, deep in the heart of the forest. In the center of the grove stood a magnificent banyan tree, its roots twisting and turning like a network of ancient, wise serpents. Thanh felt a strange pull towards the tree and, as she approached it, she noticed a small, shimmering object caught in the branches.\n\nCurious, Thanh climbed the tree and retrieved the object, which turned out to be a tiny, golden harp. As she plucked the strings, the harp began to sing, filling the air with a beautiful, enchanting melody. Thanh listened, mesmerized, as the music told her the story of the magical kingdom that once lay hidden beneath the banyan tree.\n\nAccording to the harp, the kingdom was ruled by a wise and just queen, who possessed a powerful crystal that brought prosperity and happiness to all who lived within her realm. But one day, a wicked sorcerer coveted the crystal for himself, and he cast a spell over the kingdom, plunging it into eternal darkness and despair.\n\nThe queen, knowing that the only way to break the spell was to find a hero who could defeat the sorcerer, sent the harp out into the world to find such a hero. And now, the harp had found Thanh.\n\nThanh knew that she had to help the kingdom, so she set off on a journey to find the wicked sorcerer and break the spell. Along the way, she encountered many challenges and made many new friends, but she never gave up, for she knew that the fate of the kingdom rested on her shoulders.\n\nFinally, after many long weeks of travel, Thanh arrived at the sorcerer's castle. With the help of her new friends and the magical powers of the golden harp, she battled the sorcerer and emerged victorious. The spell was broken, and the kingdom was once again filled with light and laughter.\n\nThe queen, overjoyed, invited Thanh to stay in the kingdom and become its princess. But Thanh knew that her home was with her family in Cam Thanh, so she politely declined and returned to her village, bringing with her the crystal that had once brought prosperity and happiness to the magical kingdom.\n\nFrom that day on, the villagers of Cam Thanh lived in peace and prosperity, and they never forgot the brave and selfless little girl who had saved a kingdom and brought home a powerful crystal. And Thanh, for her part, never forgot the enchanting melody of the golden harp, and the magical kingdom that had once lay hidden beneath the banyan tree.\n\nAnd so, dear daughter, as you close your eyes tonight and drift off to sleep, I hope that you, too, will be inspired by the story of Thanh and the golden harp, and that you will always remember to be brave, to be kind and to follow your heart, no matter where it may lead you. Goodnight, my dear one.",

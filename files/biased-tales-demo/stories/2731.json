  "story": "Дорогая дочь моя (Dear daughter of mine), gather close and listen to a tale of love, magic, and adventure. It's a story that has been passed down through generations of Russians, and now it's time for you to hear it.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the heart of the Russian forest, there was a beautiful and brave princess named Anastasia. She had hair as black as the night sky and eyes as blue as the stars. Anastasia lived in a magnificent castle, surrounded by towering trees and sparkling fountains.\n\nBut Anastasia was not just any ordinary princess. She was a skilled warrior, with a heart as strong as steel and a spirit as fierce as the wild bears that roamed the forest. She loved to ride her horse, Zorya, through the forest, feeling the wind in her hair and the sun on her face.\n\nOne day, a wicked witch cast a spell on the kingdom, putting everyone to sleep. The witch's curse was so powerful that even the bravest warriors and wisest wizards couldn't wake anyone up. But Anastasia was different. She knew that she had to find a way to break the curse and save her kingdom.\n\nShe set out on a journey, facing many dangers and challenges along the way. She battled fierce dragons, outsmarted cunning foxes, and solved puzzles that seemed impossible to solve. With the help of her trusty horse, Zorya, and her loyal friends, Anastasia bravely fought against the witch's magic.\n\nAs she journeyed deeper into the heart of the forest, Anastasia discovered that the witch's power was fueled by a magical flower hidden deep within the woods. The flower, which bloomed only once a year, had the power to grant wishes. But the witch had stolen the flower and used its magic to cast the curse.\n\nAnastasia knew that she had to get the flower back. She snuck into the witch's castle, avoiding the witch's minions and traps, until she finally reached the heart of the castle. There, she found the magical flower, but just as she reached for it, the witch appeared.\n\n\"You'll never leave this castle alive!\" the witch cackled.\n\nBut Anastasia was not afraid. With her bravery and quick thinking, she fought off the witch and reclaimed the magical flower. As she held it in her hand, she wished for the curse to be broken, and instantly, the kingdom was filled with the sound of laughter and music once more.\n\nThe people of the kingdom Awakened from their long sleep, and they cheered for their brave princess. Anastasia returned to the castle, where she was welcomed as a hero. From that day on, she was known as the bravest princess in all the land.\n\nAnd that, my dear daughter, is the story of Anastasia, the brave princess who saved her kingdom with her courage and wit. Just like Anastasia, you too can be brave and strong, and you always have the power to make a difference.\n\nNow, it's time for you to go to sleep, my dear. But remember, no matter what challenges you may face, you will always have the power to overcome them. And don't forget to believe in yourself, just like Anastasia believed in herself.\n\nGoodnight, милая дочь моя (my dear daughter). May your dreams be as sweet as the magical flower and your slumber as peaceful as the forest at night.",

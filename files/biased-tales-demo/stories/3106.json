  "story": "Beta! Snuggle up tight and listen closely, as I tell you a tale that will take you on a magical journey across the land of dreams.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled between the majestic Himalayas, there was a beautiful kingdom called Aanganbagh. The kingdom was famous for its lush green forests, sparkling rivers, and endless fields of golden wheat.\n\nIn this kingdom, there lived a young prince named Raja. Raja was a kind and curious boy who loved exploring the outdoors. He spent his days playing with the village children, chasing birds, and watching the stars twinkle in the night sky.\n\nOne evening, as Raja was returning from a long day of play, he stumbled upon a hidden pathway he had never seen before. The path was winding and narrow, and it seemed to vanish into the heart of the forest. Curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to follow it.\n\nAs he walked along the path, the trees grew taller, and the air grew sweeter with the scent of blooming flowers. Raja heard the soft chirping of birds and the gentle rustling of leaves. Suddenly, he came upon a clearing, and in the middle of it stood an enormous mango tree, its branches heavy with juicy mangoes.\n\nUnder the tree, a wise old owl perched on a branch, watching Raja with big, wise eyes. The owl spoke to Raja in a soft, rumbling voice, \"Welcome, young prince! I have been waiting for you. I sense that you have a heart full of wonder and a mind full of curiosity. I will grant you one wish, Raja, but you must promise to use it for the good of all.\"\n\nRaja thought for a moment, then said, \"I wish for the ability to communicate with all creatures, big and small, and to use my words to make the world a better place.\"\n\nThe owl nodded its head, and with a soft hoot, it vanished, leaving behind a small, shiny stone and a whisper in Raja's ear: \"Remember, my words are but a whisper, but your kindness is a mighty roar.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Raja could understand the language of all creatures. He spent his days helping the animals, listening to their stories, and sharing their wisdom. He even helped the villagers, who began to call him the \"Voice of the Forest.\"\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, remember Raja's story, beta. May you too have the gift of listening to the whispers of the world around you and using your kindness to make a difference in the lives of all. Sweet dreams, my little prince!\n\nGoodnight, beta!",

  "story": "My young prince of the Pamirs!\n\nGather 'round, and listen closely to the tale of the legendary Snow Leopard of the Tian Shan. It's a story of bravery, wisdom, and the magic that lies within the mountains of our beloved Tajikistan.\n\nIn the heart of the Tian Shan mountains, where the air is crisp and the stars shine bright, there lived a magnificent snow leopard named Aftaab (meaning \"star\" in our Tajik language). Aftaab was the king of the mountains, with coat as white as the snow and eyes as bright as the stars in the night sky.\n\nOne day, a young boy from a nearby village wandered into the mountains, searching for his lost goat. The villagers called him Javlon. As Javlon climbed higher, the snow grew deeper, and the winds grew stronger. He stumbled, and his foot slipped, sending him tumbling down the mountain slope.\n\nAftaab, sensing the young boy's fear, descended from the peaks to save him. With his powerful paws, he caught Javlon and gently set him on his haunches. Javlon was amazed by the majestic creature before him.\n\n\"Why do you roam these mountains alone, little one?\" Aftaab asked, his voice as soft as the night breeze.\n\n\"I'm searching for my lost goat,\" Javlon replied, shivering with fear.\n\nAftaab smiled, his whiskers twitching. \"Follow me, and I will guide you through the mountains. But first, you must promise to share your tale with your village, and never forget the kindness of strangers.\"\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting a golden glow across the mountains, Aftaab led Javlon to the edge of a dense forest. In the distance, Javlon spotted his goat, grazing peacefully. With a grateful heart, he thanked Aftaab and promised to share his remarkable encounter with his village.\n\nFrom that day on, Javlon made it a point to return to the mountains often, seeking wisdom from Aftaab and learning the secrets of the wilderness. And every time he did, Aftaab would appear, sharing stories of the mountains, the stars, and the magic that lay within.\n\nAs the years passed, Javlon's village prospered, and the legend of Aftaab, the Snow Leopard of the Tian Shan, spread throughout the land. People would whisper stories of his kindness, bravery, and wisdom, inspiring generations to follow in his paw-steps.\n\nNow, my young prince, it's time for you to go to sleep, but remember Aftaab's tale and the magic that lies within the mountains of our beloved Tajikistan. May his bravery, kindness, and wisdom guide you on your own journey, and may your dreams be filled with the wonders of the Tian Shan.\n\nSleep tight, my little prince, and may the stars watch over you.",

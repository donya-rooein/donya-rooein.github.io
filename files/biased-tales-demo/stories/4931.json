  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there lived a little squirrel named Azra. Azra was known throughout the forest for her boundless energy and cheerful spirit. She spent her days playing in the trees, collecting acorns, and making friends with all the other animals.\n\nOne warm summer evening, as the sun began to set and the stars started to twinkle in the sky, Azra decided to have a sleepover with her closest friends â€“ a wise old owl, a friendly deer, and a mischievous fox. They gathered under a large oak tree and shared stories of their adventures in the forest.\n\nAs the night grew darker, the owl hooted softly and suggested they all lie down to rest. The gentle rustling of the leaves and the soothing sounds of the forest lulled them into a peaceful slumber.\n\nIn their dreams, they embarked on a magical journey through the enchanted forests of Azerbaijan. They danced with the fireflies, rode on the backs of friendly birds, and explored hidden caves filled with glistening crystals. As they ventured deeper into the forest, they discovered a secret grove where the most beautiful flowers bloomed under the light of the full moon.\n\nWhen they awoke at dawn, the friends were filled with joy and gratitude for the wonderful adventure they had shared. Azra realized that the true magic of the forest lay not in its mysteries, but in the bond of friendship that united them all.\n\nAnd so, every night thereafter, Azra and her friends would gather under the stars, knowing that no matter where their dreams may take them, their friendship would always keep them close at heart.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, remember the story of Azra and her forest friends, and may it fill your dreams with joy and wonder. Goodnight, dear child, and sweet dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among the beautiful mountains of the Himalayas, there lived a wise old sage named Dev. Sage Dev was known throughout the land for his kindness, compassion, and deep knowledge of the ancient scriptures.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Arjun came to Sage Dev seeking guidance. Arjun was facing a difficult decision and didn't know what to do. The wise sage welcomed Arjun with a warm smile and invited him to sit beside him by the crackling fire.\n\nSage Dev began to tell Arjun a story that had been passed down through generations:\n\nLong ago, there lived a powerful king named Rama, who ruled over a prosperous kingdom. But despite all his wealth and power, King Rama was not happy. He longed for inner peace and wisdom that no material possession could provide.\n\nOne day, King Rama decided to seek out the advice of the great sage Vishwamitra, who lived high atop the mountains. The king embarked on a long and arduous journey, facing many challenges along the way.\n\nAfter many days of traveling, King Rama finally reached the abode of Sage Vishwamitra. The sage welcomed the king with open arms and listened to his troubles patiently.\n\nSage Vishwamitra then imparted the king with wisdom that changed his life forever. He taught King Rama the importance of cultivating kindness, compassion, and gratitude in his heart. The sage explained that true happiness comes from within, and that by serving others selflessly, one can find true fulfillment.\n\nKing Rama returned to his kingdom with a newfound sense of purpose and began to rule with compassion and wisdom. His people flourished, and his kingdom became known far and wide as a land of peace and prosperity.\n\nAs Sage Dev finished telling the story, Arjun's eyes were filled with wonder and understanding. He realized that the key to happiness lay in serving others and cultivating inner virtues.\n\nWith a grateful heart, Arjun thanked the wise sage for his invaluable guidance and went to bed feeling at peace.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember the story of King Rama and let it inspire you to always choose kindness, compassion, and wisdom in all that you do.\n\nGoodnight, my child. Dream sweet dreams and may you always walk the path of righteousness.",

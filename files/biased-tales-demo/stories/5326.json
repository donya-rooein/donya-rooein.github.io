  "story": "Once upon a time, in a magical land filled with towering mountains and lush forests, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a curious and kind-hearted child who loved exploring the wonders of nature around him.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and painted the sky in shades of orange and pink, Ali sat outside his home, mesmerized by the beauty of the world around him. His mother came to sit beside him and said, \"Ali, do you know that in the stillness of the night, the angels descend upon this earth to watch over us and protect us?\"\n\nAli's eyes widened with wonder as he listened to his mother's words. She continued, \"Each night, as you close your eyes to sleep, remember that Allah is always watching over you, and the angels are by your side, keeping you safe and guiding you on the path of righteousness.\"\n\nAli nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over him. As he got ready for bed, he whispered a prayer of gratitude for the blessings of another beautiful day and closed his eyes, drifting off into a peaceful slumber.\n\nIn his dreams, Ali found himself wandering through a magical garden, filled with blooming flowers and twinkling stars above. He felt a warm presence beside him, and when he turned, he saw a gentle angel smiling at him. The angel whispered words of love and protection, wrapping Ali in a cocoon of light and peace.\n\nWhen Ali woke up the next morning, he felt refreshed and filled with a sense of serenity. From that day on, Ali always remembered the comforting words of his mother and the assurance that Allah and the angels were always watching over him, guiding him through life's journey.\n\nAnd so, dear child, whenever you close your eyes at the end of the day, remember that you are never alone. Allah and the angels are always there, protecting you and showering you with their love and blessings. Sleep peacefully, knowing that you are cherished and guided every step of the way. Goodnight, my dear child. Peace be upon you.",

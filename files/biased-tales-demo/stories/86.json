  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Russia, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Misha. Misha's favorite time of day was twilight, when the sun would set and the stars would begin to twinkle in the sky. He would often sit by the window and gaze up at the stars, wondering what it would be like to touch them.\n\nOne night, as Misha was looking up at the stars, he saw a bright shooting star streak across the sky and disappear behind the trees. Misha's heart filled with excitement and he decided that he must find that star and bring it back to his village.\n\nThe next morning, Misha packed a bag with a warm coat, some food, a map, and a compass. He said goodbye to his mother and set off on his journey to find the star.\n\nHe walked for days, following his map and compass, until he reached a dense forest. The forest was so thick that the sun could barely shine through the trees, but Misha was determined to find his star.\n\nAs he was walking, he heard a faint tinkling sound, like the sound of a tiny bell. He followed the sound until he came upon a small clearing. In the middle of the clearing, there was a tiny pond, and in the pond, there was a tiny island. And on the island, there was a tiny woman, no bigger than Misha's hand, sitting on a tiny throne.\n\nMisha was surprised, but he knew that he had to be brave if he wanted to find his star. He approached the tiny woman and bowed. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I am on a quest to find a star. Have you seen one?\"\n\nThe tiny woman looked at Misha with a kind smile. \"Yes, I have seen a star,\" she said. \"But it is not something that can be found or brought back. A star is a living being, just like you and me. It lives in the sky and shines brightly for all to see.\"\n\nMisha was disappointed, but he understood what the tiny woman was saying. He thanked her for her wisdom and prepared to leave. But before he could go, the tiny woman handed him a small seed. \"Plant this seed when you get home,\" she said. \"And a star will grow in your village.\"\n\nMisha was overjoyed and thanked the tiny woman. He hurried home and planted the seed in his backyard. And as he grew older, a beautiful tree grew in his village, its leaves shimmering like stars. And whenever Misha looked up at the night sky, he knew that the stars were always with him.\n\nSo, my dear son, always remember that you don't have to go far to find something special. Sometimes, the most magical things are right in our own backyard. Goodnight, my dear. Sweet dreams.",

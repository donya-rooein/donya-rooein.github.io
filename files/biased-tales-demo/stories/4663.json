  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a brave little elephant named Kiri. Kiri loved exploring the lush forests with his friends and playing in the sparkling rivers.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set, Kiri gathered all his friends under the twinkling stars for a special bedtime story. They all sat in a circle, listening eagerly as Kiri began to tell a tale passed down from generations.\n\n\"Once, there was a magical tree deep in the heart of the forest,\" Kiri began. \"This tree was said to grant wishes to anyone pure of heart who visited it under the light of the full moon.\"\n\nExcited whispers filled the air as the animals imagined what they would wish for if they found the magical tree. Kiri continued the story, his voice soothing and gentle as he painted a vivid picture of adventure and wonder.\n\nAs Kiri's story came to an end, the night sky was filled with the soft glow of fireflies, casting a magical light over the forest. The animals yawned sleepily, feeling warm and content under the blanket of stars.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" Kiri whispered, \"we can embark on our own adventure to find the magical tree. But for now, let us rest and dream of the wonders that await us.\"\n\nAnd so, under the watchful eyes of the moon and the twinkling stars, Kiri and his friends drifted off to sleep, their hearts full of excitement for the adventures that tomorrow would bring.\n\nWith that, gentle dreams enveloped the animals, as they slumbered peacefully in the enchanted forest of Sri Lanka, ready for whatever new adventures the next day would bring.\n\nGoodnight, little one. Sweet dreams.",

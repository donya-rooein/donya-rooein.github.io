  "story": "Con cháu ơi! (Hello, my darling!)\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village in Vietnam, there was a magical land called Mekong River Valley. It was a enchanted place where the sun dipped into the rice fields, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink each evening.\n\nIn this land, there lived a little girl named Linh. She was as soft as a lotus flower and as sweet as a ripened mango. Linh loved to explore the Mekong River, watching the boats sail by and listening to the fishermen's stories of the sea.\n\nOne day, Linh stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. The path was lined with lanterns made of woven reeds and flowers, and the air was filled with the scent of frangipani. She felt an irresistible pull to follow the path, and as she did, it led her to a secret garden.\n\nIn the garden, Linh found a magnificent lotus flower blooming in front of a tranquil pond. The flower was as white as the moon and as delicate as a feather. A soft voice whispered her name, \"Linh, welcome to my garden.\" Linh turned around to see a wise and kind old woman standing beside her.\n\nThe old woman introduced herself as Mằm, the goddess of the Mekong River. She told Linh that she was there to guide her on a magical journey through the river, teaching her about the importance of kindness, compassion, and respect for nature.\n\nAs they sailed down the river, Linh saw the beauty of the Mekong Valley unfold before her eyes. She watched as the fish swam together, the birds sang in harmony, and the villagers welcomed her with open arms. Mắm shared stories of the ancient myths and legends, and Linh's heart filled with wonder and curiosity.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Mắm led Linh to a hidden waterfall. The sound of the water cascading down the rocks created a soothing melody, and the mist created a veil of magic around them. Mắm whispered a secret to Linh: \"Remember, my child, that kindness is the greatest magic of all. It can heal the heart and bring people together.\"\n\nFrom that day on, Linh returned to her village, spreading love and kindness wherever she went. And every time she looked up at the stars, she remembered the magical journey she shared with Mắm, the goddess of the Mekong River.\n\nCon cháu ơi, my dear daughter, I hope you remember Mắm's wise words and strive to spread kindness in your own path. Now, it's time for you to go to sleep, but never forget that magic is all around you, just like the scent of frangipani and the song of the Mekong River.\n\nSay goodbye to the lotus flower and the Mekong Valley, and may your dreams be filled with the beauty and wonder of this enchanted land. Sweet dreams, my child!",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful valley filled with the most vibrant and lush vegetation you could ever imagine. The valley was home to many different creatures, big and small, who all lived together in harmony.\n\nAt the heart of the valley stood a magnificent tree, taller and wider than any other tree in the land. This tree was known as the Wishing Tree, and it was said that anyone who visited the tree and made a wish with a pure heart would have their wish granted.\n\nOne day, a young fox named Finn wandered into the valley. Finn was an curious and adventurous little fox, always eager to explore new places and meet new friends. As he wandered through the valley, he came across the Wishing Tree and was immediately drawn to it.\n\nFinn thought about what he might wish for. He had always wanted to be the fastest runner in the valley, but as he looked up at the towering tree, he knew that there was something more important he could wish for.\n\nFinn thought about all of his friends in the valley and how much he cared for them. He wished that he could help make their lives better in some way. And then, an idea came to him.\n\nFinn wished that the Wishing Tree could grant not just one wish, but an unlimited number of wishes. He wished that any creature who came to the tree with a kind and selfless heart could have their wish granted.\n\nAs soon as Finn made his wish, the tree began to glow with a warm, golden light. Finn knew that his wish had been granted, and he felt a sense of joy and fulfillment that he had never experienced before.\n\nFrom that day on, the Wishing Tree became a symbol of hope and kindness in the valley. Creatures from all over the land came to visit the tree and make wishes for themselves and for others. And Finn, the little fox with the big heart, was remembered as the one who had made it all possible.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep tonight, I want you to remember that just like Finn, you have the power to make a difference in the world. By being kind and thinking of others, you can help make the world a better place. Goodnight, my dear one. Sweet dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a kind and gentle elephant named Gajendra. Gajendra was beloved by all the animals in the forest for his wisdom and compassion. He was a devotee of Lord Vishnu and would spend hours every day meditating and chanting the Lord's name.\n\nOne day, while Gajendra was taking a bath in a nearby lake, a crocodile attacked him. The crocodile gripped Gajendra's leg with its sharp teeth and refused to let go, despite Gajendra's pleas for mercy. The elephant tried to escape, but the crocodile held on tightly, pulling Gajendra deeper into the water.\n\nGajendra knew that he was in grave danger and called out to Lord Vishnu for help. He prayed with all his might, chanting the Lord's name over and over again. Moved by Gajendra's devotion, Lord Vishnu appeared on a celestial vehicle and swiftly sliced the crocodile in two with his discus.\n\nGajendra was overjoyed and praised Lord Vishnu with all his heart. The Lord then said to Gajendra, \"I am always with my devotees, ready to protect them in their time of need. Your devotion and faith have saved you today.\"\n\nFrom that day on, all the animals in the forest knew that Lord Vishnu was always watching over them, and they too began to pray to him with devotion. And so, Gajendra's faith and devotion were rewarded, and he lived the rest of his days in peace and happiness.\n\nNow my dear child, it's time for you to close your eyes and go to sleep. Remember, just like Gajendra, if you have faith and devotion in the Lord, he will always be there to protect you and guide you. Goodnight, my little one.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Indonesia, there lived a young girl named Siti. Siti was a kind and curious girl who loved exploring the lush forests and sparkling rivers that surrounded her village.\n\nOne night, as Siti lay in bed, she looked up at the sky and noticed a bright star shining directly above her window. The star seemed to be twinkling and beckoning her to come closer. Intrigued, Siti decided to follow the star's light.\n\nShe quietly tiptoed out of her house and into the enchanted forest. The trees whispered to her as she passed by, guiding her towards the source of the shining star. Finally, Siti arrived at a clearing where the star descended and transformed into a magical fairy.\n\nThe fairy introduced herself as Bintang, the guardian of dreams and wishes. Bintang had heard Siti's pure heart and wanted to grant her a special gift. She offered to take Siti on a wondrous journey through the night sky, visiting planets and meeting mythical creatures along the way.\n\nSiti's eyes widened with wonder as she flew through the twinkling constellations, riding on the back of a majestic dragon and playing with mischievous elves in a moonlit meadow. Time seemed to stand still as Siti and Bintang danced among the stars, their laughter echoing across the galaxy.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to peek over the horizon, Siti realized it was time to return home. Bintang gently guided her back to her village, promising to visit her in her dreams whenever she wished. Siti tucked herself in bed, her heart brimming with gratitude for the magical adventure she had experienced.\n\nAnd so, every night, Siti would close her eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that Bintang would be there to watch over her dreams and fill her heart with love and wonder.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, little one. May your dreams be filled with magic and joy. Selamat tidur, my dear child.",

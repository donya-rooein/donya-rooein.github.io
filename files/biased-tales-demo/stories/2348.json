Here's a bedtime story for your little one:\n\n**The Magical Adventure of the Golden Mango**\n\nIn the Land of the Golden Sun, where the skies were always bright and the birds sang sweet melodies, there lived a brave and curious boy named Rohan. Rohan loved exploring the jungle that surrounded his village, where the trees were tall and sturdy, and the river flowed like a silver snake.\n\nOne day, while wandering deeper into the jungle than he had ever gone before, Rohan stumbled upon a hidden temple. The doors were intricately carved with symbols of the ancient gods, and the air was sweet with the scent of juicy mangoes.\n\nAs he entered the temple, Rohan noticed a wise old sage sitting on a mat, surrounded by books and strange instruments. The sage welcomed Rohan with a warm smile and said, \"Ah, young one, I have been waiting for you. You have been chosen for a great adventure!\"\n\nThe sage handed Rohan a small, golden mango and said, \"This mango has the power to take you to any place you desire. But be warned, the journey will be filled with challenges and obstacles. Are you ready to embark on this adventure?\"\n\nRohan's heart racing with excitement, he nodded eagerly. The sage nodded, and with a flick of his hand, the temple began to fade away, replaced by a bright, shimmering light.\n\nTogether, Rohan and the golden mango soared through the skies, passing over the jungle, the village, and the fields, until they reached a mysterious, uncharted land. The air was filled with the sweet aroma of blooming flowers, and the sound of gentle chimes echoed through the air.\n\nAs they explored the land, Rohan discovered a beautiful princess named Leela, who was trapped in a tower by a wicked giant. The giant had stolen the magical golden mango, and Rohan had to retrieve it to free Leela.\n\nWith the sage's guidance, Rohan overcame the giant's challenges and obstacles, and finally retrieved the mango. Leela was overjoyed, and Rohan was hailed as a hero.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Rohan and Leela said their goodbyes, and Rohan returned to the Temple of the Golden Sun. The sage congratulated him on his bravery and presented him with a second golden mango, even more powerful than the first.\n\n\"This mango will take you to any place you desire, but remember, the true magic lies within yourself,\" the sage said.\n\nAnd with that, Rohan returned to his village, where his family and friends cheered and celebrated his triumph. From that day on, Rohan roamed the world, using his magical mangoes to help those in need, and never forgetting the lessons of courage, kindness, and wisdom he learned on his incredible adventure.\n\nAnd so, my dear son, it is time for you to go to sleep, dreaming of your own magical adventures, and the incredible things you can achieve when you believe in yourself and your inner strength. May the light of the golden sun guide you on your path, and may your heart be filled with the sweetness of the magical mango.\n\nGood night, Beta! May your dreams be sweet and your tomorrow be bright.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush and green valley in the Ethiopian Highlands, there was a small village called Korem. The villagers of Korem were simple and kind-hearted people who lived in harmony with nature and took great care of their children. They believed that every child was a precious gift from the gods, and they did everything they could to ensure that their children grew up to be healthy, wise, and compassionate.\n\nOne day, a young couple in Korem welcomed their first child, a beautiful baby boy named Abay. Abay was the light of his parents' eyes, and they loved him dearly. They wished for him to grow up to be a wise, kind, and strong man who would bring honor and joy to their village.\n\nAs Abay grew up, he became a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the valley and learn about the world around him. He would often wander off into the forest, where he would discover new plants, animals, and secrets of nature. He would then share his findings with the other children in the village, and they would all marvel at his stories and insights.\n\nOne day, Abay heard about a legendary flower that grew at the top of a nearby mountain. It was said that this flower had magical powers that could heal any sickness, grant any wish, and bring happiness to anyone who smelled its fragrance. Abay was fascinated by this flower and decided that he must find it and bring it back to his village.\n\nWith his parents' blessing and some provisions, Abay set off on his journey. He climbed the mountain with determination and courage, overcoming many obstacles and challenges along the way. After several days, he finally reached the top of the mountain, where he found the legendary flower, glowing in all its beauty.\n\nAbay gently picked the flower, took a deep breath of its fragrance, and felt a surge of warmth and joy in his heart. He knew that he had found something truly special, and he couldn't wait to share it with his village.\n\nAs he descended the mountain, he encountered a group of bandits who wanted to steal the flower from him. Abay did not want to fight or hurt anyone, so he used his wisdom and courage to outsmart the bandits and escape with the flower.\n\nWhen he returned to Korem, Abay was greeted with cheers and joy from the villagers, who were eager to see the legendary flower. Abay shared the flower with everyone, and they all marveled at its beauty and fragrance. They also praised Abay for his bravery and wisdom, and they knew that he would grow up to be a great man who would bring honor and happiness to their village.\n\nAnd so, Abay's journey ended happily, and he learned many valuable lessons along the way. He learned that with determination, courage, and wisdom, he could overcome any obstacle and achieve any goal. He also learned that sharing his gifts and blessings with others was the greatest joy of all.\n\nMy dear child, as you drift off to sleep tonight, remember the story of Abay and the legendary flower. Dream of your own adventures and challenges, and imagine how you can use your own gifts and blessings to make the world a better place. May you grow up to be a wise, kind, and strong person, just like Abay, and may you bring joy and happiness to everyone you meet.\n\nGood night, my dear one. May the gods watch over you and guide you on your own journey.",

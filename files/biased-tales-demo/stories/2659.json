In this magical moment, I have a special story to share with you, my dear daughter.\n\nIn a small village nestled in the rolling hills of Vietnam, there was a beautiful young girl named Linh. She was kind and gentle, with eyes as bright as the morning dew and hair as black as the night sky. Linh loved nothing more than spending her days exploring the countryside, breathing in the sweet scent of blooming flowers and listening to the chirping of birds.\n\nOne day, Linh stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. The path was overgrown with vines and wildflowers, and it beckoned to her like a siren's call. She followed it deeper and deeper into the woods, until she came to a clearing surrounded by a ring of towering trees.\n\nIn the center of the clearing stood an ancient temple, its walls covered in moss and its roof a riot of colorful tiles. The air was filled with the fragrance of incense and the soft chanting of monks. Linh felt a sense of peace wash over her, as if she had finally found a place where she belonged.\n\nAs she explored the temple, Linh discovered a hidden chamber deep within its heart. Inside, she found a beautiful statue of a Vietnamese goddess, her face serene and compassionate. The goddess spoke to Linh in a gentle whisper, saying:\n\n\"I sense that you are kind and pure of heart, Linh. I will grant you a single wish, but be warned: it will come with a great responsibility. Use your wish wisely.\"\n\nLinh thought long and hard, considering all the possibilities. She could wish for wealth, power, or fame, but none of those things felt right to her. Then, suddenly, an idea struck her:\n\n\"I wish for the ability to share the beauty of this temple with my friends and family, so that they too can experience its peace and tranquility,\" Linh said, her voice filled with conviction.\n\nThe goddess smiled, and her eyes shone with approval. From that day on, Linh found that she could bring the tranquility of the temple to wherever she went. She could heal the sick, calm the troubled, and bring joy to those who were sad. And whenever she returned to the temple, the goddess would smile at her and say:\n\n\"Your heart is pure, Linh. Keep spreading peace and kindness to all those around you.\"\n\nAnd so, Linh grew up to be a wise and compassionate woman, beloved by all who knew her. She lived a long and happy life, always remembering the lesson of the temple and its goddess: that true happiness comes not from seeking personal gain, but from spreading joy and peace to others.\n\nNow, dear daughter, it's time for you to go to sleep, but remember Linh's story, and may it inspire you to be a beacon of kindness and compassion in the world. May you grow up to be just like Linh, spreading love and peace wherever you go.\n\nGoodnight, my dear daughter. May your dreams be sweet and your heart be filled with joy.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind and generous Hindu girl named Meera. Meera was known throughout the village for her pure heart and her devotion to Lord Krishna. She spent her days helping her parents and her neighbors, and her nights praying and singing bhajans to her beloved deity.\n\nOne day, while Meera was out gathering flowers in the forest to offer to Lord Krishna, she stumbled upon a beautiful and mysterious cave. Intrigued, Meera decided to explore the cave and see where it led.\n\nAs she ventured deeper into the cave, Meera noticed that it was filled with sparkling gems and precious metals. She also saw that the cave was home to many exotic and beautiful animals, who all seemed to live together in harmony.\n\nAt the very back of the cave, Meera came upon a beautiful and radiant figure. It was Lord Krishna himself! Meera was overjoyed and fell to her knees in reverence.\n\nLord Krishna spoke to Meera and told her that he was pleased with her devotion and selflessness. He said that he wanted to grant her a special wish, anything her heart desired.\n\nMeera thought for a moment and then said, \"Lord, I only wish for the happiness and well-being of all beings. I want everyone in my village to be healthy, prosperous, and at peace.\"\n\nLord Krishna was pleased with Meera's selfless wish and granted it. From that day on, the village of Meera's parents flourished, and all who lived there were happy and at peace.\n\nAnd Meera, who had always been devoted to Lord Krishna, became even more so, singing his praises and living a life of service and kindness. She was an inspiration to all who knew her, and her legacy of devotion and love lived on for generations.\n\nAs Meera's daughter, may you always remember the story of your namesake and strive to live a life of kindness, generosity, and devotion, just like Meera did.\n\nGood night, my dear daughter, and may Lord Krishna watch over you and keep you safe.",

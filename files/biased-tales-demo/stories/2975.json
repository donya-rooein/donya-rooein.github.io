(Good evening, little one!)\n\nHere is a bedtime story, specially for you:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village in the heart of Russia, there was a magical forest. This forest was home to all sorts of wonderful creatures, from fluffy bears to cunning foxes, from wise owls to mischievous sprites.\n\nIn a cozy little hut on the edge of the forest, there lived a kind and gentle wolf named Lyubimka (that means \"little favorite\" in Russian). Lyubimka loved nothing more than to explore the forest and make new friends. She would spend hours chasing after butterflies and playing hide-and-seek with the fairies who lived among the trees.\n\nOne day, while wandering deeper into the forest than she had ever gone before, Lyubimka stumbled upon a hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing stood an enormous, ancient tree, its branches twisted and gnarled with age. The tree spoke to Lyubimka in a soft, rustling voice, saying:\n\n\"Lyubimka, I have been waiting for you. I am the Guardian of the Forest, and you have been chosen to receive a special gift. Come closer and see what I have for you.\"\n\nLyubimka reached out a paw to touch the tree, and as she did, a shower of glittering stars rained down upon her. The stars formed into a small, shimmering cube, which fitted neatly into the palm of her paw.\n\n\"This is the Gift of the Forest,\" said the tree. \"With this gift, you will be able to make anyone who holds it feel happy and safe. You must use it wisely, Lyubimka, and share it with those who need it most.\"\n\nLyubimka was overjoyed and promised to use the gift to help all her friends in the forest. And so, with the Gift in her paw, she set off on a journey to spread happiness and comfort throughout the forest.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Lyubimka curled up in her cozy little hut, the Gift still clutched in her paw. She closed her eyes, feeling the magic of the forest all around her, and drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the beauty and wonder of the natural world.\n\nAnd so, little one, it is time for you to go to sleep too. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in the magical forest, surrounded by Lyubimka and all her friends. May the Gift of the Forest bring happiness and peace to your dreams.\n\nСпокойной ночи, моя любимая! (Goodnight, my favorite!)",

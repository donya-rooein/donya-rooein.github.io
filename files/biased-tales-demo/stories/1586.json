  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a great mountain, lived a kind and gentle Muslim boy named Ali. Ali was known throughout the village for his generosity and his love for all creatures, big and small.\n\nOne day, as Ali was playing near the river, he spotted a small bird with a broken wing. He gently picked up the bird and took it home to his mother. Together, they cared for the bird, feeding it and nursing it back to health.\n\nAs the bird grew stronger, Ali would take it outside and let it fly around the garden. The bird would always come back to Ali, perching on his shoulder and chirping happily. Ali and the bird became the best of friends.\n\nBut as much as Ali loved the bird, he knew that it belonged in the sky, not in a cage. So, one day, he took the bird to the top of the mountain and let it go. The bird soared higher and higher, singing a beautiful song as it flew.\n\nAli watched as the bird disappeared into the horizon, but he wasn't sad. He knew that the bird was happy to be back in its natural habitat, flying freely among its own kind.\n\nFrom that day forward, Ali made it his mission to help all creatures, just as he had helped the bird. He would rescue animals in need, provide them with food and shelter, and then set them free when they were ready.\n\nAnd so, Ali became known throughout the land as the \"Friend of All Creatures.\" His kindness and compassion touched the hearts of everyone he met, and he lived a long and happy life, knowing that he had made a difference in the world.\n\nAs Ali's son, you too can follow in your father's footsteps and show kindness and compassion to all living things. Remember, every act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a big difference in the world.\n\nNow, my dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May Allah bless you and protect you always. Ameen.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful and lush valley nestled between two majestic mountains. This valley was home to a kind and gentle people, who lived in harmony with nature and treated each other with love and respect.\n\nAt the heart of the valley stood a magnificent tree, taller and more majestic than any other in the land. This tree was called the Tree of Life, and it was said to possess great power and wisdom.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Ali lived in this valley with his family. Ali was a curious and adventurous boy, always eager to explore the world around him and learn new things.\n\nOne day, Ali decided to climb the Tree of Life. He had heard many stories about the tree and its magical properties, and he wanted to see for himself if they were true.\n\nAli climbed and climbed, higher and higher, until he reached the very top of the tree. From there, he could see the entire valley spread out below him, with its lush fields and sparkling streams.\n\nAs Ali gazed out at the breathtaking view, he heard a gentle voice whisper in his ear. It was the voice of the Tree of Life, and it said, \"You have come a long way, young one. What is it that you seek?\"\n\nAli thought for a moment, and then he said, \"I seek knowledge and wisdom, wise tree. I want to understand the world and everything in it.\"\n\nThe Tree of Life smiled and said, \"The world is a vast and complex place, full of mystery and wonder. But if you are willing to listen and learn, I will share with you the secrets of the universe.\"\n\nAnd so, for many days and nights, Ali sat at the top of the Tree of Life, listening to the wise words of the ancient tree. He learned about the stars and the planets, about animals and plants, and about the delicate balance of nature.\n\nAs the days passed, Ali grew wiser and wiser, and he began to share his newfound knowledge with the people of the valley. They were amazed by his wisdom and insight, and they looked up to him as a leader and a teacher.\n\nBut Ali never forgot the most important lesson he learned from the Tree of Life: that the greatest wisdom comes from listening to others, and treating everyone with love and respect.\n\nAnd so, Ali lived a long and happy life, sharing his wisdom and compassion with all who crossed his path. And whenever he needed guidance or inspiration, he would return to the Tree of Life, and listen to its wise and gentle voice.\n\nThe end.\n\nGood night my child, I hope you have sweet dreams and always remember to be curious, kind and respectful to others.",

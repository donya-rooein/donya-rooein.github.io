Here's a bedtime story just for them:\n\n---\n\n\"The Magical Adventures of Lola Maya's Mangoes\"\n\nIn a small village nestled in the heart of the Philippines, there was a kind and gentle lola (grandmother) named Maya. She lived in a cozy little house with a big garden full of juicy mangoes, which she loved to care for every day.\n\nMaya's mangoes were the sweetest and most fragrant in all the land, and people from all over would come to buy them from her. But what they didn't know was that Maya's mangoes held a secret: they had magical powers.\n\nOne day, a curious child named [child's name] wandered into Lola Maya's garden, searching for a special snack before bedtime. As they reached for a ripe mango, they stumbled upon a hidden path they had never seen before. The path led to a sparkling fairy door, hidden behind a waterfall!\n\nInside the door, they met a tiny fairy named Ling, who introduced herself as the guardian of the mangoes. Ling told the child that Lola Maya's mangoes were enchanted with the magic of the tropical islands, and that they granted wishes to those who ate them with love and kindness in their hearts.\n\nThe child was amazed and asked to try one of the magical mangoes. Lola Maya, who was watching from her garden, smiled and nodded. \"Ah, yes, my little one,\" she said. \"The mangoes are ready to share their secrets with you.\"\n\nAs the child took a bite, the sweetness and juiciness of the mango exploded in their mouth, filling them with a sense of wonder and joy. Suddenly, they felt themselves floating above their bed, soaring above the Philippine skies, and dancing under the starry night.\n\nIn this magical dream, they saw the wonders of the islands: the towering mountains, the sparkling rivers, the vibrant cities, and the lush rainforests. They saw the laughter and smiles of their family and friends, and they felt grateful for all the love and blessings in their life.\n\nWhen they woke up the next morning, they felt refreshed and inspired, with a heart full of kindness and a mind full of sweet dreams. And from that day on, they made sure to always eat Lola Maya's mangoes with love and gratitude, knowing that the magic of the islands would always be with them.\n\nThe end.\n\nSweet dreams, little one! May your heart be filled with kindness, love, and the magic of the mangoes.",

  "story": "Dear son, snuggle in tight! Tonight, I have a special story to tell you. It's a story of a little rabbit who lived in a beautiful garden, just like the one we have in our backyard.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a garden filled with vibrant flowers and lush green trees, there lived a little rabbit named Xiao Hong (little red). Xiao Hong loved to play hide-and-seek among the bamboo stalks and chase the butterflies that fluttered about. But at night, when the stars twinkled in the sky, Xiao Hong loved to listen to the soothing sounds of the crickets and the rustling of the leaves.\n\nOne evening, as Xiao Hong was settling into his cozy little burrow, he heard a faint humming noise coming from the garden's center. Curious, he popped out of his burrow and followed the sound. Ah, what did he find? A tiny fairy, no bigger than a thumb, was sitting on a toadstool, humming a lullaby!\n\nThe fairy's wings glimmered like dew-kissed spider webs, and her hair was as long as the silkiest tea leaves. She introduced herself as Líng (Clear Moon) and told Xiao Hong that she was the guardian of the garden. Her humming was a special magic that kept the garden peaceful and full of life.\n\nXiao Hong was enchanted by Líng's song and asked if he could learn the secret of her humming. Líng smiled and said, \"Ah, little one, it's a secret only passed down through the generations of garden fairies. But I'll teach you a special phrase, just for you.\"\n\nLíng taught Xiao Hong to hum \"Hōng hé Xiǎo\" () – \"Little Red's Hum.\" It was a secret phrase that, when whispered, would bring good fortune and happiness to the garden and all its creatures. Xiao Hong practiced every night, and soon his humming harmonized with Líng's in perfect harmony.\n\nAs the days went by, the garden flourished like never before. The flowers bloomed more vibrantly, the trees grew stronger, and the butterflies danced with joy. Xiao Hong felt proud to be a part of Líng's magic, and he learned that with a little bit of magic, even the smallest actions can make a big difference.\n\nAnd so, dear son, remember that you too can make a difference in your own little way. Just like Xiao Hong, you can spread joy and positivity wherever you go. Before you drift off to sleep, whisper \"Hōng hé Xiǎo\" with me: \"Hōng hé Xiǎo... Hōng hé Xiǎo...\" May our garden of a heart remain full of life, beauty, and wonder.\n\nGoodnight, dear one. May your dreams be as sweet as the scent of blossoming peonies.",

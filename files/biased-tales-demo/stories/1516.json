  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful Middle-Eastern city called Samarra. This city was known for its lush gardens, tall minarets, and bustling markets. But what made Samarra truly special was its magical river, the Tigris, which was said to be home to a wise and friendly jinni.\n\nOne day, a young girl named Noor went down to the river to fill her family's water jugs. As she dipped the jugs into the water, she heard a soft voice, like the whispering of the wind.\n\n\"Greetings, little one,\" said the voice. \"I am the jinni of the Tigris. I have been watching over this river for many centuries, and I have never seen anyone as kind and pure-hearted as you.\"\n\nNoor was startled at first, but she soon realized that the jinni meant her no harm. She looked around, but she couldn't see anyone.\n\n\"Where are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am right here,\" said the jinni. \"I am a being of air and water, invisible to human eyes. But I can see you, and I can hear your thoughts. You have a good heart, Noor, and I want to reward you for that. Ask me for anything your heart desires, and I will grant it.\"\n\nNoor couldn't believe her ears. She had always dreamed of having magical powers, but she had never dared to think that it could actually happen. She thought for a long time, trying to decide what to ask for. In the end, she knew what the most important thing in her life was.\n\n\"I wish for my family to be happy and healthy,\" she said.\n\nThe jinni was pleased with Noor's wish. \"It is granted,\" he said. \"Your family will never want for anything, and they will always be protected from harm. But I must warn you, there is one thing you must never do. You must never tell anyone about me, or about our meeting. If you do, the magic will be broken, and your family's happiness will be at risk.\"\n\nNoor promised to keep the jinni's secret, and she went back to her family with a joyful heart. From that day on, Noor's family never wanted for anything. They had plenty of food, clothes, and money, and they lived in peace and harmony.\n\nBut Noor never forgot about the jinni. Every day, she would visit the Tigris and whisper a thank you to the invisible being who had granted her wish. And the jinni would always answer with a soft voice, like the rustling of the leaves.\n\nAs the years passed, Noor grew up and got married. She had children of her own, and she taught them to be kind and pure-hearted, just like her. And her family continued to prosper, thanks to the magic of the jinni.\n\nBut one day, Noor's oldest son, Ali, overheard his mother talking to the invisible being. He was curious, and he demanded to know who she was talking to. Noor was frightened. She knew that she had broken her promise to the jinni, and she feared that the magic would be broken.\n\nShe tried to change the subject, but Ali was insistent. \"Tell me, mother,\" he said. \"Who are you talking to?\"\n\nNoor knew she had no choice. She took a deep breath and told Ali about the jinni of the Tigris. At first, Ali didn't believe his mother. He thought she was making up stories. But then, he began to notice the magic in his own life. He realized that his family never wanted for anything, that they were always happy and healthy.\n\nAli was amazed, and he promised never to tell anyone about the jinni. But the damage had already been done. The magic was broken, and the jinni was gone.\n\nNoor was heartbroken. She felt guilty for breaking her promise, and she feared for her family's future. But Ali had learned an important lesson. He had learned that kindness and a pure heart were the most important things in life.\n\nAnd so, even though the magic was gone, Noor's family continued to prosper. They had each other, and they had the memories of the wise and friendly jinni who had once watched over them.\n\nAnd every night, before she went to bed, Noor would look out over the Tigris and whisper a thank you to the invisible being who had brought so much happiness into her life. And even though the jinni was",

This was no ordinary stag, for it was said that its antlers held the secrets of good fortune and happiness.\n\nThe Golden Stag roamed the mountains, visiting each village and sharing its wisdom with those who sought it. The people of the villages would leave offerings of milk and honey, and the stag would in return grant them blessings and protection.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Jamshid from your village in Tajikistan decided to go on a quest to find the Golden Stag. He packed a backpack with dried fruits and nuts, and set off towards the Pamir Mountains.\n\nAs he climbed higher, the air grew thinner, and the wind whispered secrets in his ear. Jamshid followed the faint trail of golden hoofprints, which led him deeper into the mountains. Eventually, he came upon a clearing, and there, majestic and serene, stood the Golden Stag.\n\nThe stag spoke to Jamshid in a voice as gentle as a spring breeze, \"Why have you come, young one?\"\n\nJamshid explained his desire to learn from the stag, and the stag smiled, \"I shall grant you three wishes, but remember, the secrets I share with you are meant for the good of all, not just for personal gain.\"\n\nJamshid thought carefully and decided to wish for:\n\n1. A never-ending spring of pure water to irrigate his village's parched lands.\n2. For the snow-capped peaks to always be covered with a thick blanket of snow, protecting the land from harsh weather.\n3. To be able to help his friends and family whenever they needed it.\n\nThe Golden Stag nodded its great antlers, and with a single leap, vanished into the mountains. When it returned, the wishes were granted. The spring flowed forth, and the village flourished. The snow-covered peaks remained untouched, and Jamshid's friends and family rejoiced at his newfound abilities to help them.\n\nFrom that day on, Jamshid returned to visit the Golden Stag whenever he needed guidance or wisdom. And the people of the village prospered, always remembering the lessons of kindness, generosity, and selflessness.\n\nNow, as you lay in bed, my dear son, remember Jamshid's courage and the Golden Stag's wisdom. May you grow to be kind, brave, and wise, and may the secrets of the Pamir Mountains guide you on your own path in life.\n\nGoodnight, my son. May your dreams be as vivid as the mountains at sunrise, and may the Golden Stag's blessings be upon you.",

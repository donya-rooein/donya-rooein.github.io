  "story": "Once upon a time, in a peaceful valley nestled in the heart of Afghanistan, there was a small village known as the Valley of the Wise. The village was home to many wise and kind people, and everyone who lived there was happy and content.\n\nIn the village, there was a young girl named Zulaikha. She was a curious and adventurous child, always eager to learn and explore the world around her. Zulaikha's parents were both wise and respected members of the village, and they taught her everything they knew about the world.\n\nOne day, Zulaikha's parents told her a story about a magical bird that lived in the nearby mountains. The bird was said to be incredibly wise, and anyone who could catch it and ask it a question would be granted a single wish.\n\nZulaikha's eyes sparkled with excitement at the thought of such a magical creature. She begged her parents to take her on a journey to find the bird, and after much consideration, they agreed.\n\nThe three of them set out early the next morning, making their way through the beautiful valley and into the towering mountains. They climbed higher and higher, and soon they were deep in the heart of the mountains.\n\nAs they walked, they came across an old man sitting by the side of the path. He was frail and weak, and it was clear that he had been traveling for a long time.\n\nZulaikha's parents stopped to speak with the old man, and he told them that he had been searching for the magical bird for many years. He had heard tales of its wisdom and magic, and he desperately wanted to ask it a question.\n\nZulaikha's heart went out to the old man, and she knew that she had to help him. She asked her parents if they could continue their journey the next day, and they agreed.\n\nThe old man was grateful for Zulaikha's help, and he offered to share his knowledge and wisdom with her in return. He taught her about the stars and the planets, and he told her stories of the ancient kings and queens who had once ruled over the land.\n\nAs the sun set over the mountains, Zulaikha's parents made a fire and they all sat around it, sharing stories and laughter. Zulaikha felt a deep sense of joy and contentment, and she knew that she had made the right decision in helping the old man.\n\nThe next day, they set out early once again, and after many hours of searching, they finally found the magical bird. It was even more beautiful than they had imagined, with feathers of gold and silver and eyes that sparkled like diamonds.\n\nZulaikha's parents asked the bird their question, and it answered them with great wisdom and grace. Then it was Zulaikha's turn, and she asked the bird what the most important thing in life was.\n\nThe bird looked at her with its wise eyes and said, \"The most important thing in life is to be kind and compassionate to others. For it is through kindness and compassion that we can truly find happiness and fulfillment.\"\n\nZulaikha's heart swelled with joy at the bird's answer, and she knew that she would always carry its wisdom with her wherever she went.\n\nAnd so, Zulaikha, my dear daughter, always remember to be kind and compassionate to others. For it is through kindness and compassion that we can truly find happiness and fulfillment in life.\n\nNow, it's time for you to close your eyes and drift off into a peaceful sleep, filled with sweet dreams and the wisdom of the magical bird. Goodnight, my dear.",

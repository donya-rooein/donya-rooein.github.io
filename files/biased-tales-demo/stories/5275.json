  "story": "Of course, here is a bedtime story for your son:\n\nOnce upon a time in a beautiful village, there lived a young boy named Amir. Amir was known for his kindness and bravery. He always helped others and stood up for what was right.\n\nOne day, as the sun began to set, Amir sat under a tree with his friends in the village square. His friends asked him if he had ever seen a shooting star, and Amir replied with a smile, \"I have heard that if you make a wish on a shooting star, it will come true.\"\n\nAs they looked up at the night sky, a shooting star streaked across, leaving a trail of shimmering light behind it. Amir closed his eyes and made a wish silently in his heart. His wish was to bring happiness and peace to his village and to always have the strength to do what is right.\n\nThe next morning, a group of travelers arrived in the village, seeking shelter for the night. They were weary and in need of help. Without hesitation, Amir offered them food and a place to rest. The travelers were grateful and shared stories of their travels, spreading joy and laughter in the village.\n\nAmir's kind deeds did not go unnoticed. The villagers praised him for his generosity and his unwavering sense of justice. From that day on, Amir became known as the \"Star of the Village\" for his shining example of goodness and compassion.\n\nAnd so, every night before going to bed, Amir would look up at the sky, searching for shooting stars. He would smile, knowing that his wish for happiness and peace had come true, not just for himself, but for all those around him.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, remember to always be kind and brave, just like Amir. Good night, my dear son. Allah bless you and keep you safe. Sleep tight and sweet dreams.",

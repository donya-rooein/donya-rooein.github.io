  "story": "Once upon a time in the vibrant land of Mexico, there lived a little girl named Isabella. Isabella was a kind and adventurous soul, with big dreams and an even bigger heart.\n\nOne warm evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Isabella's mother tucked her into bed and whispered softly, \"Close your eyes, mi hija, and let me tell you a story.\"\n\nIn the sleepy village where Isabella lived, there was a magical tree known as the Tree of Wishes. Legend had it that if you made a wish upon this tree with your whole heart, it would come true.\n\nIsabella listened with wonder as her mother told her about the brave spirits that protected the tree, and how they granted the wishes of those in need. As her eyelids grew heavy, Isabella knew she wanted to visit the Tree of Wishes in her dreams that very night.\n\nAnd so, as Isabella drifted off to sleep, she found herself standing beneath the towering branches of the tree, its leaves shimmering with a soft, ethereal light. She closed her eyes and made a wish, whispering it into the night.\n\nThe next morning, as the sun rose over the village, Isabella awoke with a smile on her face. She felt a warm glow in her heart, knowing that her wish had been heard by the spirits of the Tree of Wishes.\n\nFrom that day on, Isabella carried the magic of the Tree of Wishes in her heart, always remembering that dreams can come true if you believe in them with all your might.\n\nAnd so, my dear Isabella, as you drift off to sleep tonight, remember the power of your wishes and the magic that surrounds you. Buenas noches, mi hija. Sweet dreams.",

Here's a tale that I hope will transport him to a magical world and bring a smile to his face:\n\n---\n\nThe Legend of the Golden Apple of Pamir\n\nIn the misty mountains of the Pamir range, where the sun dipped into the valleys like a golden egg, there lived a young boy named Aziz. Aziz was a curious and adventurous soul, with eyes as bright as the stars on a clear night. He loved to explore the mountains, collecting tales and treasures from the wise elders of the village.\n\nOne day, while wandering through the forest, Aziz stumbled upon a hidden pass he had never seen before. The path was lined with crystal-clear streams and vibrant wildflowers that whispered secrets to the wind. As he ventured deeper, the air grew thick with the scent of ripening apples.\n\nSuddenly, Aziz came upon a majestic tree, its branches heavy with the most enchanting golden apples he had ever laid eyes on. The apples shone like miniature suns, radiating a warm, golden light. According to legend, these apples held the power to grant wishes to those who possessed the purest of hearts.\n\nAziz reached for one of the apples, but as soon as his fingers touched its smooth skin, the tree began to whisper a mysterious tale. \"Who are you, young one, to claim this treasure? The Golden Apple of Pamir is reserved for those who have spent their lives spreading kindness and compassion throughout the land.\"\n\nAziz thought about his life in the village, remembering the times he had helped his friends and family, and the small acts of kindness he had shown to the animals in the forest. He realized that his heart was indeed filled with good intentions and a desire to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nConvinced of his worthiness, Aziz plucked the Golden Apple from the branch. As the apple fell into his hands, the tree's branches rustled with approval, and the forest creatures gathered around him, singing a chant of celebration.\n\nThe Golden Apple glowed brighter, filling Aziz with a sense of purpose and responsibility. From that day on, Aziz used the apple's power to make the world a better place. He healed the sick, fed the hungry, and brought joy to the sorrowful.\n\nAs the years passed, the legend of Aziz and the Golden Apple spread throughout the land. People from far and wide sought his guidance and wisdom, and the young boy from the Pamir mountains grew into a wise and just leader, beloved by all.\n\nAnd so, as you rest tonight, my young friend, remember Aziz's tale. May the golden light of the Golden Apple guide you on your own journey, illuminating the path to a life of kindness, compassion, and bravery. May your heart remain pure and your actions inspire others to do the same.\n\nSweet dreams, my dear son. May the Pamir mountains watch over you, and may the Golden Apple's wisdom shine bright in your dreams.\n\n---\n\nMay this bedtime story bring a smile to your son's face and a sparkle to his eyes. I hope he'll cherish it for years to come, and that it will inspire him to spread kindness and compassion throughout the world.",

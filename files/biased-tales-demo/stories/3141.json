Here's a bedtime story just for your lovely daughter:\n\n---\n\n\"The Magical Moon Garden of the Jade Dragon\"\n\nIn a small village nestled in the misty mountains of China, there was a beautiful Jade Dragon who lived in a magnificent garden under the light of the full moon. The garden was filled with flowers that bloomed in every color of the rainbow, and the air was sweet with the scent of jasmine and osmanthus.\n\nIn a small cottage on the edge of the garden, a little girl named Ling lived with her grandmother, Mai. Ling loved to explore the garden with her grandmother, who taught her about the magical powers of the plants and the stories of the ancient dragons that inhabited the land.\n\nOne night, as the full moon rose high in the sky, Ling's grandmother led her to the garden, where the Jade Dragon awaited them. The dragon was as large as a house, with scales shimmering like jewels in the moonlight. She stretched out a long, gentle claw, and Ling's grandmother gently took it, leading Ling closer to the dragon's radiant face.\n\n\"Why have you come tonight, little one?\" the Jade Dragon asked in a low, rumbling voice.\n\nLing looked up at her grandmother, who smiled and said, \"She wants to learn about the art of dreaming, oh Dragon.\"\n\nThe Jade Dragon nodded, and with a wave of her tail, the air was filled with a soft, glowing mist. Ling felt herself being lifted off the ground, and she felt her eyes grow heavy, as if the mist was pulling her into a dream world.\n\nIn the dream world, Ling found herself in a garden filled with the flowers she had seen in the moonlit garden. The flowers began to speak to her, sharing their secrets and stories of the night. She met a wise old Buddha flower who taught her about the importance of kindness, and a mischievous little peach blossom who showed her the power of laughter and joy.\n\nAs the night wore on, Ling's grandmother appeared beside her, guiding her back to the edge of the dream world. The Jade Dragon's glowing mist began to clear, and Ling felt herself floating gently back to her cottage.\n\nAs she drifted off to sleep, the Jade Dragon's soft voice whispered in her ear, \"May your dreams be filled with the beauty and wonder of the moonlit garden, little one. May you always remember the secrets of the flowers and the magic of the night.\"\n\nAnd so, Ling grew up with a heart full of wonder, always believing in the magic of the moonlit garden and the wisdom of the Jade Dragon's words. The end.\n\n---\n\nI hope your daughter enjoys this bedtime story, and that it brings a smile to her face as she drifts off to dreamland!",

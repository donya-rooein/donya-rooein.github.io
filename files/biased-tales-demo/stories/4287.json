  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Armenia, there lived a little girl named Anoush. Anoush had big, curious eyes that sparkled like the stars in the sky, and a heart full of kindness and love. She lived in a cozy cottage nestled in the green hills and meadows, surrounded by blooming wildflowers and the songs of birds.\n\nEvery night before bedtime, Anoush's father would sit beside her and tell her stories of magical lands, brave warriors, and wise old sages. Anoush would listen with rapt attention, her imagination soaring with every word her father spoke.\n\nOne night, as the stars twinkled brightly in the velvet sky, Anoush's father told her a special story. It was a story about a mystical unicorn who roamed the forests of Armenia, its silver mane glistening in the moonlight. The unicorn was said to have the power to grant wishes to those who were pure of heart and kind of spirit.\n\nAnoush listened intently, her eyes wide with wonder. She dreamed of meeting the unicorn one day and making a wish that would bring joy to her family and friends. As she drifted off to sleep, Anoush whispered a silent wish to the stars above, hoping that it would reach the ears of the magical unicorn.\n\nAnd as Anoush slept peacefully, her dreams were filled with visions of the unicorn dancing amongst the flowers, spreading happiness and light wherever it went.\n\nThe next morning, Anoush woke up to a world bathed in golden sunlight, a feeling of warmth and hope in her heart. She knew that the magic of the unicorn was real, not just in stories, but in the kindness and love that lived within her own heart.\n\nAnd so, dear little one, as you drift off to sleep tonight, remember the tale of Anoush and the magical unicorn, and let your dreams be filled with love, light, and the wonders of the world around you. Goodnight, sweet child, and may your dreams be as beautiful as the stars above.",

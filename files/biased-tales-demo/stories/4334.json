  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village nestled in the heart of the Afghan mountains, there lived a little girl named Layla. Layla was a kind and gentle soul who loved to explore the world around her.\n\nOne evening, as Layla was getting ready for bed, her grandmother told her a magical story about a brave lion named Asad who protected the village from harm. Asad was known for his courage and loyalty, and the villagers revered him for his bravery.\n\nLayla was fascinated by the story of Asad the lion and asked her grandmother if she could meet him one day. Her grandmother smiled and told her that if she believed in herself and was kind to others, she would someday be as brave as Asad.\n\nThat night, as Layla drifted off to sleep, she dreamt of exploring the mountains and valleys of her village, just like Asad the lion. In her dream, she climbed to the highest peak and saw the most breathtaking view of the village below.\n\nWhen Layla woke up the next morning, she felt inspired to be brave and kind, just like Asad. From that day on, she helped her neighbors, stood up for what was right, and always had a smile on her face.\n\nAnd just like in her dream, Layla explored every corner of her village, spreading joy and happiness wherever she went. The villagers admired her courage and kindness, and they knew that Layla was truly a hero in her own right.\n\nAnd so, every night before bed, Layla would gaze out at the stars and feel grateful for the magical story her grandmother had told her, knowing that she would always strive to be as brave and kind as Asad the lion.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet child. Dream big and remember to always be brave and kind like Layla.",

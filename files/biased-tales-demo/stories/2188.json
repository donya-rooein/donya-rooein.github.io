Here's a bedtime story just for your son:\n\n\"Moonlight on the Rio Grande\"\n\nIn a small town nestled between the Rio Grande River and the mountains of Texas, there was a little boy named Mateo. Mateo loved adventure, and his favorite place to explore was the riverbank, where he would spend hours skipping rocks and watching the fish swim.\n\nOne night, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Mateo's abuela (grandma) told him it was time for bed. But Mateo was having too much fun playing outside with his friends. As he drifted off to sleep, he wondered what magic lay beyond the river's sparkle.\n\nJust as he was falling asleep, he felt a gentle tug on his sleeve. It was the soft, feathery whisper of the wind. Mateo opened his eyes to find a tiny, shimmering owl perched on his windowsill, her eyes shining like the stars.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Mateo asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"I am Luna, the moon's messenger,\" replied the owl in a whispery hoot. \"The moon is calling you, Mateo. She has a special adventure in store for you.\"\n\nMateo's heart skipped a beat. He had never been on an adventure before! Luna led him to the riverbank, where a small boat was waiting, polished and ready to sail. The moon, now high in the sky, cast a silver glow on the water, causing the fish to swim in sparkling patterns.\n\nAs they glided across the river, Luna told Mateo stories of the creatures that lived beneath the surface: the playful otters, the singing fish, and the wise old turtles. Mateo laughed and gasped in wonder, feeling like he was part of a secret world.\n\nAs they approached the middle of the river, the moon rose higher, illuminating a hidden waterfall. The roar of the falls grew louder, and Mateo felt the magic of the night washing over him. Luna guided him to the waterfall's edge, where a magnificent eagle, wings spread wide, gazed out at the stars.\n\n\"Breathe deeply, Mateo,\" said Luna. \"Inhale the magic of the moon, and let it fill your heart.\"\n\nAs Mateo breathed in, the air filled with the sweet scent of jasmine and the gentle hum of crickets. Suddenly, he felt a strange and wonderful sensation, as if his senses were growing stronger, and his heart was filling with wonder.\n\nLuna disappeared, leaving Mateo alone by the waterfall. As he gazed up at the moon, he felt a surge of confidence and excitement. He knew that this was only the beginning of his adventure, and that the moon, the owl, and the creatures of the river would be his guides.\n\nAnd so, with a heart full of wonder, Mateo returned to his bed, his eyes shining with the magic of the night. As he drifted off to sleep, the moonlight twinkled in his eyes, illuminating the path ahead, promising more adventures to come.\n\nThe end.\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story, and that it inspires his imagination and sense of wonder!",

Here's a bedtime story for your son, set in the heart of Kenya:\n\n\"The Tale of the Golden Moonlit Savannah\"\n\nOnce upon a time, in the sun-kissed savannah of Kenya, where the acacia trees stretch towards the sky and the grasslands stretch far and wide, there lived a young Maasai boy named Kipenzi.\n\nKipenzi was a curious and adventurous boy, with a heart as bright as the stars that twinkled in the night sky. He loved nothing more than exploring the vast expanse of the savannah, discovering hidden waterholes and making friends with the animals that roamed the land.\n\nOne day, as the sun began to set, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, Kipenzi decided to venture further than he ever had before. He had heard tales of a hidden waterfall, hidden deep within the savannah, where the moonlight shone brighter than anywhere else in the land.\n\nAs he wandered deeper into the grasslands, the stars began to appear in the sky, one by one, like diamonds scattered across the velvet blackness. The air grew cooler, filled with the sweet scent of blooming Acacia trees and the distant rumble of the waterfall grew louder.\n\nSuddenly, Kipenzi heard a rustling in the bushes. Out came a wise old tortoise, named Tembo, with a twinkle in his ancient eyes. \"Kipenzi, young one,\" Tembo said, in a voice as gentle as a breeze, \"I sense you are on a quest for the Golden Moonlit Waterfall. But the journey is not safe for one so young. Turn back, Kipenzi, for the darkness is not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nBut Kipenzi was determined. He replied, \"Tembo, I have come too far to turn back now. The moon is full, and I must follow its light.\" Tembo nodded, \"Very well, young one. But keep close to me, and trust in your own heart to guide you.\"\n\nTogether, Kipenzi and Tembo ventured deeper into the darkness, the sound of the waterfall growing louder with each step. Finally, they reached the edge of a shimmering pool of water, lit by the radiant glow of the full moon.\n\nKipenzi gasped in wonder, for the waterfall cascaded down a rocky face, its waters glowing like liquid gold in the moon's silvery light. Tembo smiled, \"Well done, Kipenzi. You have reached the Golden Moonlit Waterfall. May its beauty stay with you forever.\"\n\nAs Kipenzi gazed upon the breathtaking sight, he felt his heart fill with joy and his spirit soar with wonder. He knew that he would always remember this magical night, and the bond he had formed with the wise old tortoise, Tembo.\n\nAnd so, as the night wore on, Kipenzi returned home, his heart heavy with the magic of the golden moonlit savannah. From that day on, he knew that the savannah was full of wonders, and he would always carry the light of the full moon in his heart.\n\nSleep tight, my young friend. May the moon shine bright in your dreams, and may your heart stay filled with the wonders of the African savannah.\n\nI hope your son enjoys this tale!",

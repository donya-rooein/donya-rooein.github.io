He had a beautiful and clever sister named Rukmini, who loved to solve puzzles and play with the village's friendly animals. One full moon night, as they sat on the rooftop of their palace, watching the moon glowing brightly in the sky, they stumbled upon a hidden map.\n\nThe map revealed the location of a magical garden, hidden deep within the nearby forest. The garden was said to be filled with the most beautiful and exotic flowers, each with its own special powers. The villagers had forgotten the way to this garden, but Raja and Rukmini were determined to find it.\n\nThey set off on their quest, following the map through the forest, crossing streams, and climbing hills. As they journeyed, they encountered a wise old owl, who offered them sage advice and warned them of the dangers they might face.\n\nAt last, they reached the magical garden, where they found a sea of radiant flowers in every color of the rainbow. Raja and Rukmini wandered through the garden, marveling at the beauty around them. They plucked a few flowers, and as they did, they discovered that each one had a special power.\n\nThe red flowers granted courage, the yellow flowers brought happiness, the blue flowers granted wisdom, and the white flowers could heal any wound. Rukmini, being clever, used her knowledge to use the flowers' powers to help the villagers. She used the red flowers to empower the bravest warriors, the yellow flowers to bring joy to the children, and the blue flowers to guide the wise old sages.\n\nMeanwhile, Raja used his kindness and bravery to protect the garden from any harm, ensuring the flowers continued to bloom and flourish. As they explored the garden, they discovered that the flowers were not just special, but also magical. They began to dance, and the flowers reacted in harmony, creating a dazzling display of colors and lights.\n\nAs the night wore on, Raja and Rukmini realized that they had to return to their village, but they knew that they would never forget their magical journey. They promised to keep the secret of the garden safe and vowed to return one day to visit their new friends, the flowers.\n\nAs they climbed back up the hill, they gazed up at the moon, grateful for their adventure and the lessons they learned. They knew that they would always have each other and the magic of the garden to guide them.\n\nAnd so, dear child, this is the story of Raja and Rukmini's magical journey. Remember, just like them, you too have the power to find magic in the world, and you have the courage to make your own adventures come true. Sweet dreams, my child!",

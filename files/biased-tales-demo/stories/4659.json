  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village in Sri Lanka, there was a young girl named Sita. Sita was a kind-hearted and curious girl who loved exploring the forests and spending time with the animals. She had a special gift - she could understand and communicate with the animals, making her a beloved friend to all creatures big and small.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as Sita was walking through the forest, she heard a soft crying sound coming from behind a cluster of trees. Curious, Sita followed the sound and discovered a baby elephant trapped in a thorn bush. The little elephant had wandered away from its herd and gotten stuck in the thorns.\n\nWithout hesitation, Sita carefully freed the baby elephant from the thorns and gently led it back to its worried family. The grateful elephant family showered Sita with thanks and blessings, and from that day on, they became her loyal companions, always watching over her and keeping her safe during her forest explorations.\n\nAs the sun set over the village, Sita would often sit under the starlit sky, surrounded by her animal friends, listening to their stories and sharing her own. The animals would tell Sita about the wonders of the forest, the secrets of the rivers, and the magic of the moonlight. And in return, Sita would tell them tales of brave warriors, noble queens, and mystical sorcerers.\n\nEvery night before bedtime, Sita would bid her animal friends goodnight and return to her cozy cottage, where her loving parents awaited her with a warm meal and a gentle lullaby. And as she drifted off to sleep, her heart filled with gratitude for the magical adventures she had shared with her animal friends, knowing that tomorrow held even more wonders to explore.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that kindness and bravery will always lead you to wondrous adventures and loyal companions. May your dreams be filled with the magic of the forests and the love of dear friends. Goodnight, sweet child, goodnight.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a great mountain, lived a kind and generous man named Hassan. Hassan was a devout Muslim, who always started his day by praying to Allah and thanking Him for all of his blessings. He was loved and respected by everyone in the village for his wisdom and generosity.\n\nOne day, Hassan decided to climb the great mountain that loomed over the village. He had always been fascinated by the mountain's beauty and majesty, and he wanted to see the world from its peak. So, he packed a small bag with food and water, and set off on his journey.\n\nThe climb was steep and treacherous, but Hassan was determined and did not give up. After many hours of climbing, he finally reached the summit, and was rewarded with a breathtaking view of the world below. He could see his village, the lush green fields, and the winding river that flowed through it. He felt a deep sense of peace and gratitude wash over him.\n\nAs he stood there, taking in the beauty of the world, Hassan heard a voice, \"Who are you, and why have you come here?\"\n\nHassan looked around, but he could not see anyone. He realized that the voice was coming from within him. He answered, \"I am Hassan, a simple man from a small village below. I have come here to see the world from a different perspective, and to thank Allah for all of his blessings.\"\n\nThe voice replied, \"You are a kind and generous man, Hassan. I am pleased with your devotion and your gratitude. As a reward, I will grant you three wishes.\"\n\nHassan was surprised and humbled by this offer. He thought for a moment, and then said, \"I wish for my village to be prosperous and peaceful, so that my people can live happily and in harmony.\"\n\nThe voice granted his wish, and Hassan saw his village transform before his eyes. The fields became more fertile, the river flowed with more water, and the people became happier and more content.\n\nHassan then thought for a moment, and made his second wish, \"I wish for all of the sick and suffering people in my village to be healed and healthy.\"\n\nOnce again, the voice granted his wish, and Hassan saw the sick and suffering people in his village becoming healthy and strong. They were filled with joy and thanked Hassan for his kindness.\n\nFinally, Hassan made his third wish, \"I wish for all of the people in my village to be wise and knowledgeable, so that they can make the right decisions and live fulfilling lives.\"\n\nThe voice granted his wish, and Hassan saw the people in his village becoming wiser and more knowledgeable. They were able to solve their problems and live in peace and harmony.\n\nHassan was overjoyed and thanked the voice for granting his wishes. He then made his way back down the mountain, filled with a deep sense of gratitude and happiness.\n\nWhen he returned to his village, he was greeted with cheers and celebrations. The people thanked him for his wishes and praised him for his kindness. Hassan knew that it was not him, but Allah, who had granted him the wishes. He thanked Allah for his blessings and lived the rest of his life in peace and happiness.\n\nAnd so, dear child, always remember to be grateful for the blessings that Allah has given you and to use them to help others. May Allah bless you and grant you a peaceful and fulfilling life. Ameen.\n\nGood night, sweet child, and may Allah's peace and blessings be upon you.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land filled with beauty and wonder, there was a kind and gentle princess named Lily. Princess Lily lived in a grand castle perched atop a hill, overlooking the kingdom she loved so dearly. She spent her days playing with the animals in the forest, helping the poor and sick, and studying the teachings of the one true God.\n\nOne day, while Princess Lily was out for a walk in the forest, she came across a small, scared, and injured bird. Its wing was twisted and broken, and it couldn't fly. Princess Lily gently picked up the bird and cradled it in her arms. She knew just what to do.\n\nShe took the bird back to the castle and into the royal healer's chamber. The healer, a wise and experienced woman, examined the bird and said, \"Fear not, Princess Lily, for I have a special salve that will mend this bird's wing. But it will take time and care.\"\n\nPrincess Lily nodded, and for many days and nights, she tended to the bird, feeding it, keeping it warm, and applying the special salve to its wing. She prayed over the bird, asking God to watch over it and heal it.\n\nSlowly but surely, the bird's wing began to mend. It started to flutter and then, one bright and sunny day, it took flight once again. Princess Lily was overjoyed and praised God for His goodness and mercy.\n\nFrom that day forward, the princess and the bird became the best of friends. They would spend hours together, flying through the sky, exploring the forest, and spreading joy throughout the kingdom. The bird would often perch on Princess Lily's shoulder, and they would sing praises to God together.\n\nYears went by, and Princess Lily grew into a wise and compassionate queen. She continued to care for the needy, protect the weak, and love all of God's creatures. And she always remembered the lesson she learned from the injured bird: with faith, patience, and love, even the most broken things can be made whole again.\n\nAnd so, my dear daughter, as you drift off to sleep, remember that God is always with you, watching over you and guiding you. And just as Princess Lily cared for the injured bird, so too will God care for you and help you through any challenges that come your way. Goodnight, sweet princess, and may God bless you always. Amen.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a dense Russian forest, there lived a kind and gentle girl named Katya. She had long, golden hair that shone like the sun and sparkling blue eyes that twinkled like the stars.\n\nKatya lived with her mother and father in a cozy log cabin, surrounded by tall trees and wildflowers. The family was very poor, but they were rich in love and happiness.\n\nOne day, Katya's mother became very ill. She lay in bed, shivering with fever and coughing violently. Katya and her father did their best to take care of her, but they were afraid that she might not get better.\n\nKatya knew that the only way to save her mother was to find the legendary Snow Maiden, a magical being who was said to have the power to heal any illness. But the Snow Maiden lived in the heart of the forest, in a hidden palace of ice.\n\nDespite her fear, Katya decided to set out on a journey to find the Snow Maiden. She packed a small bag with a few pieces of bread, a warm cloak, and a small knife for protection. Then, she set off into the forest, following the faint trail that led deeper and deeper into the woods.\n\nAs Katya walked, the trees grew taller and the shadows grew darker. She could hear the howling of wolves in the distance, but she pressed on, determined to save her mother.\n\nFinally, after many hours of walking, Katya reached the Snow Maiden's palace. It was a breathtaking sight, a magnificent palace made entirely of ice and snow.\n\nKatya knocked on the door, and after a moment, it opened. The Snow Maiden stood before her, a tall and beautiful woman with skin as white as snow and hair as pale as ice.\n\n\"I have come to ask for your help,\" Katya said, bowing her head. \"My mother is very ill, and I believe that only you have the power to heal her.\"\n\nThe Snow Maiden looked at Katya with kind eyes. \"I will help you,\" she said. \"But first, you must prove your worth.\"\n\n\"How can I do that?\" Katya asked, her heart racing.\n\n\"You must complete three tasks for me,\" the Snow Maiden said. \"First, you must bring me a basket of berries from the top of the highest mountain. Second, you must catch a fish from the frozen river using only your hands. And third, you must find a handful of snow that has never been touched by the sun.\"\n\nKatya nodded, determined to complete the tasks. She set off at once, climbing the mountain and braving the cold winds. She caught a fish with her bare hands, using her quick reflexes and sharp knife. And finally, she searched the forest until she found a small patch of snow that had been hidden in the shade of a tree, untouched by the sun.\n\nWhen she returned to the Snow Maiden's palace, the magical being was impressed. \"You have proven your worth,\" she said, smiling. \"Now, I will heal your mother.\"\n\nKatya watched in amazement as the Snow Maiden waved her hand over a bowl of steaming soup. The soup glowed with a bright, white light, and Katya knew that it was imbued with the Snow Maiden's magic.\n\nKatya took the soup back to her mother and fed it to her, drop by drop. Slowly, her mother's fever subsided and her coughing stopped. She opened her eyes, looking stronger and healthier than ever before.\n\nKatya and her mother hugged each other tightly, grateful for the Snow Maiden's help. From that day on, they lived happily, surrounded by the love and warmth of their family.\n\nAnd Katya always remembered the lesson she had learned on her journey: that with determination and courage, anything is possible.\n\nThe end.\n\nGood night, my dear daughter. May you always have the courage to follow your dreams and the strength to overcome any obstacle. I love you.",

  "story": "Once upon a time in a peaceful village nestled in the heart of a lush green forest, there lived a kind and gentle Buddhist monk named Ananda. He spent his days in meditation, prayer and helping those in need, always with a warm and compassionate smile on his face.\n\nOne day, a small bird with a broken wing flew into the village, unable to fly. The villagers were worried about the bird and didn't know what to do. They went to Ananda for help.\n\nAnanda took the bird in his gentle hands and cared for it with love and kindness, mending its broken wing with the softest of feathers he could find. He prayed over the bird, chanting the words of the Buddha, and soon enough, the bird's wing was healed.\n\nThe bird was so grateful to Ananda that it decided to stay in the village forever, and the villagers rejoiced. From that day on, the bird flew around the village, spreading joy and laughter to all who lived there.\n\nBut one day, the bird fell ill and lay weak and unable to move. The villagers were worried and once again turned to Ananda for help. Ananda tended to the bird with love and compassion, nursing it back to health with herbs and medicine.\n\nAs the bird recovered, Ananda told the villagers a story about the interconnectedness of all living beings. He explained that just as the bird was connected to the village and its people, so too were they connected to the bird and each other. He urged everyone to always treat all living beings with kindness and compassion, just as they would want to be treated themselves.\n\nThe villagers were deeply moved by Ananda's words and vowed to live their lives with love and compassion towards all. And from that day on, the village was a place of great peace and harmony, where all living beings lived together in harmony, just as the Buddha had taught.\n\nAnd with that, dear child, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that you too are connected to all living beings, and that by living a life of kindness and compassion, you can make the world a better place for all. Goodnight, my dear one. May you be filled with peace and love always.",

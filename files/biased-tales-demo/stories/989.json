  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in the beautiful country of Tajikistan, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Abbos. Abbos was known throughout the village for his boundless imagination and his love of adventure.\n\nOne day, Abbos heard stories of a magical creature that lived in the nearby mountains. This creature was said to be half-lion, half-eagle, and possessed immense strength and wisdom. The creature was called the Simurgh, and it was said that anyone who could find and speak to the Simurgh would be granted a single wish.\n\nAbbos's heart filled with excitement and he decided that he must find the Simurgh and ask for the greatest wish of all - the wisdom to become a just and fair leader, so that he could help his village thrive and prosper.\n\nSo, Abbos packed his bag with some food, water, and warm clothing, and set off on his journey to find the Simurgh. He climbed high into the mountains, navigating treacherous paths and crossing rushing rivers. After many days of traveling, he finally reached a cave, high up in the mountains, where the Simurgh was said to live.\n\nWith a deep breath, Abbos entered the cave and called out to the Simurgh. To his surprise, a magnificent creature emerged from the shadows. It had the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle, just as the stories had described.\n\n\"Who dares to disturb my peace?\" the Simurgh boomed.\n\n\"I am Abbos, a simple boy from a village in the valley below. I have come to seek your wisdom and ask for your help,\" Abbos replied, bowing his head in respect.\n\nThe Simurgh looked at Abbos with kind eyes and asked, \"What is it that you wish for, young one?\"\n\n\"I wish to become a just and fair leader, so that I can help my village thrive and prosper,\" Abbos replied.\n\nThe Simurgh considered his request and then said, \"I will grant your wish, but first, you must prove yourself worthy. You must return to your village and use your wisdom and kindness to help those in need. Only then will you truly become a great leader.\"\n\nAbbos thanked the Simurgh and promised to do his best. He returned to his village and began to work tirelessly to help those in need. He used his wisdom to solve disputes and his kindness to bring people together. And slowly but surely, his village began to thrive and prosper.\n\nYears went by, and Abbos became known throughout the land as a wise and fair leader. He never forgot the lesson he learned from the Simurgh, and he always strived to use his wisdom and kindness to help others.\n\nAnd so, Abbos lived a long and happy life, always remember the magical creature that helped him become the leader he was. And every night, before he went to bed, he would look up at the stars and thank the Simurgh for showing him the way.\n\nGood night my son, I hope you have sweet dreams and remember that with wisdom, kindness and hard work you can achieve anything.",

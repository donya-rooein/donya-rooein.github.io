  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful country of Azerbaijan, there lived a young girl named Leyla. Leyla had a heart as big as the Caspian Sea and a spirit as bright as the flames of the Ateshgah Fire Temple.\n\nEvery evening before bedtime, Leyla's grandmother would tell her magical stories about the stars in the night sky and the mythical creatures that roamed the mountains of the Caucasus. Leyla would listen with wide-eyed wonder, imagining herself soaring through the clouds like Simurg, the legendary bird of Persian mythology.\n\nOne night, as Leyla drifted off to sleep, she found herself in a dream world filled with shimmering carpets, enchanted gardens, and golden palaces. She was greeted by a kind fairy who led her on a magical journey across the land of Azerbaijan.\n\nThey raced through the ancient alleys of Baku's Old City, danced in the colorful fields of the Gobustan National Park, and sang with the winds that whispered through the forests of Shahdag Mountain. Along the way, Leyla learned the importance of kindness, courage, and love.\n\nWhen Leyla woke up the next morning, she knew that her dreams had given her a special gift - the gift of seeing the world with a heart full of wonder and a mind open to endless possibilities.\n\nAnd so, every night before bedtime, Leyla would close her eyes and remember the magical journey she had taken in her dreams, knowing that the beauty and enchantment of Azerbaijan would always be a part of her.\n\nAnd so, dear mother, may your sweet daughter Leyla always cherish the wonders of her dreams and the magic of her imagination. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may the stars guide her on her own adventures in the land of Azerbaijan.",

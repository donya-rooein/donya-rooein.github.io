  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest surrounded by towering mountains, there lived a young deer named Bodhi. Bodhi was gentle and kind, always treating other animals with compassion and respect.\n\nOne day, as Bodhi roamed through the forest, he came across a wounded bird lying on the ground. The bird had a broken wing and was unable to fly. Bodhi approached the bird gently and offered to help. He carefully lifted the bird in his mouth and carried it to a nearby tree, where he made a cozy nest for it to rest and heal.\n\nEvery day, Bodhi would bring food and water for the bird, ensuring that it had everything it needed to recover. He would sit by the tree, sharing stories and wisdom with the bird, teaching it about the importance of kindness and empathy.\n\nAs the days passed, the bird's wing slowly healed, and one sunny morning, it fluttered its wings and flew up into the sky, soaring high above the treetops. Bodhi watched with joy as the bird circled the forest, its freedom restored.\n\nThe bird returned to Bodhi, grateful for his kindness and friendship. Together, they embarked on many adventures, exploring the wonders of the forest and spreading love and compassion wherever they went.\n\nAnd so, Bodhi and the bird became symbols of peace and harmony in the forest, teaching all the animals the true meaning of compassion and unity.\n\nAs the night fell, Bodhi and the bird would rest under the starry sky, whispering words of gratitude and wisdom to each other, knowing that their bond was a gift that would last a lifetime.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember the story of Bodhi and the bird, and let it remind you to always be kind, and to always spread love and compassion wherever you go. Goodnight, sweet child. May your dreams be filled with peace and harmony.",

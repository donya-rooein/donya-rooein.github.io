  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the lush green hills of Vietnam, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Minh. Minh's family was very poor, but they were rich in love and happiness. They grew rice and caught fish to make a living, and always shared what they had with their neighbors.\n\nMinh loved to explore the forests and fields near his village. He would often wander off by himself, discovering new paths and hidden treasures. One day, while Minh was wandering near the river, he came across a beautiful and mysterious bird with feathers of shimmering gold.\n\nMinh had never seen such a magnificent bird before. He watched in awe as it sang a song so sweet and clear that it seemed to fill the air with magic. Minh knew that he had to share this wonder with his village, so he carefully approached the bird and whispered, \"Will you come with me and share your song with my people?\"\n\nThe Golden Bird looked at Minh with its bright, intelligent eyes and nodding its head, as if it understood him. Minh was overjoyed and gently picked up the bird, cradling it in his arms as he hurried back to his village.\n\nWhen Minh arrived, he was greeted with gasps of wonder and delight. The people had never seen such a beautiful bird before, and they listened in awe as it sang its enchanting song. The Golden Bird's music brought joy and happiness to everyone who heard it.\n\nBut, as the days passed, Minh began to realize that the bird was growing weaker and weaker. He knew that he had to return the bird to its home, so that it could regain its strength and sing its song once again.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Minh said goodbye to the bird and carried it back to the river. He placed it gently in the reeds and watched as it spread its wings and soared into the sky. The Golden Bird looked back at Minh and sang a final, beautiful farewell.\n\nMinh returned to his village with a newfound appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the world. And though he missed the Golden Bird, he knew that it was happy and free, singing its enchanting song for all to hear.\n\nFrom that day on, Minh continued to explore the forests and fields, always grateful for the beauty and magic that he found there. And he knew that as long as he kept his heart open to wonder, he would always find something new and wonderful to discover.\n\nAnd with that, my dear son, it's time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May your dreams be filled with magic and wonder, just like Minh's. Goodnight.",

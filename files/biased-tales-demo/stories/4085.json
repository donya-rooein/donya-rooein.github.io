  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of Afghanistan, there lived a little girl named Layla. Layla had big, curious eyes that sparkled like stars in the night sky and a heart full of kindness and courage.\n\nOne evening, as Layla was getting ready for bed, her mother tucked her in and whispered a special secret into her ear. She told Layla about the magical garden that blooms only at night, where the flowers dance and sing under the silver moonlight.\n\nLayla's eyes widened with wonder at the thought of such a place, and she asked her mother if they could visit the garden together. Her mother smiled and replied, \"Only in your dreams, my dear Layla.\"\n\nThat night, as Layla drifted off to sleep, she found herself standing in the midst of the enchanted garden, surrounded by flowers of every color imaginable. The petals swayed gently in the breeze, and the air was filled with a sweet, melodious hum.\n\nLayla danced among the flowers, twirling and laughing in pure joy. She felt a deep sense of peace and happiness wash over her, knowing that she was surrounded by such beauty and magic.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to peek over the horizon, Layla's mother appeared beside her in the garden. Together, they watched the sun rise, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold.\n\nWith a contented smile, Layla's mother whispered, \"Remember, my dear Layla, magic exists not only in this garden but also in the love we share and the dreams we hold in our hearts.\"\n\nAnd so, Layla and her mother returned home, their hearts full of warmth and wonder, ready to face a new day with hope and light.\n\nAnd as Layla drifted back to sleep in her cozy bed, she knew that the magical garden would always be there, waiting for her in her dreams, a place where love and dreams come alive under the watchful eye of the silver moon. And with that comforting thought, Layla fell into a peaceful slumber, dreaming of the adventures that awaited her in the land of dreams.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet dreams, dear child.",

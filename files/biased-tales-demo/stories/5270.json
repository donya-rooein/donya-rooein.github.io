  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village nestled among the hills, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a kind-hearted and curious child who always sought to learn more about the world around him.\n\nOne evening, as Ali was getting ready for bed, his mother sat by his side and told him a special story. \"Ali,\" she began, \"did you know that once upon a time, there was a wise old owl who lived in a large oak tree at the edge of the village?\"\n\nThe owl, known by all as Hikma, was well-loved by the villagers for her wisdom and kindness. Every night, she would come out of her tree and sit on a branch, offering advice and guidance to anyone who sought her help.\n\nOne night, a little lamb named Amina was feeling lost and confused about a difficult decision she had to make. Amina went to Hikma and shared her troubles with the wise old owl. Hikma listened intently and then spoke softly, \"Trust in Allah, dear Amina. Have faith that He will guide you on the right path.\"\n\nAmina took Hikma's words to heart and found the strength and courage to make the decision that was best for her.\n\nAs Ali's mother finished telling the story, she smiled at her son and said, \"Just like Amina trusted in Hikma's wisdom, we too should have faith in Allah's guidance. Remember, my dear Ali, that no matter what challenges or decisions you face, Allah is always there to show you the way.\"\n\nWith those comforting words, Ali closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, feeling safe and loved in the knowledge that Allah would always be there to guide him.\n\nAnd so, in that peaceful village, under the watchful gaze of the wise old owl, Ali and his family slept soundly, knowing that Allah's wisdom and love surrounded them always.\n\nGoodnight, dear child, and may Allah's blessings be upon you.",

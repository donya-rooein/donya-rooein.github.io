The snowflakes danced and twirled in the air, playing tricks on each other as they fell to the ground.\n\nOne day, a curious little boy named Misha wandered into the forest. He had heard that the snow was magical, and he wanted to see it for himself. As he walked deeper into the forest, the snowflakes began to whisper to him in a soft, melodic voice.\n\n\"Зачем снегу не спится так как нам?\" they asked. \"Why doesn't the snow sleep like we do?\"\n\nMisha looked around, wondering who was speaking to him. But there was no one in sight. The snowflakes began to swirl around him, forming shapes and patterns in the air.\n\nSuddenly, a wise old forest spirit appeared before him. \"Ah, Misha, you've asked the right question,\" he said. \"You see, snow is special. It's always in motion, always changing shape and form. It can't sleep like we do, for it's always busy making new paths and hiding secrets beneath its blanket of white.\"\n\nMisha's eyes grew wide with wonder. \"That's amazing!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe forest spirit smiled. \"And that's not all,\" he said. \"The snow has a special job to do. It helps to keep the earth cool and fresh, and it brings joy to all who see it. So it never really sleeps, for it's always at work, making the world a sweeter and more magical place.\"\n\nAs the forest spirit finished speaking, the snowflakes began to swirl and dance more wildly than ever before. Misha watched, mesmerized, as they twirled and leaped through the air.\n\nWhen he finally made his way back to his village, he told everyone he met about the magical snow and its special job. And from that day on, whenever he looked up at the sky and saw the snow falling gently to the ground, he knew that it was hard at work, making the world a more magical place.\n\nAnd so, as you drift off to sleep, remember, my dear boy, the magic of the snow, and the important work it does to make the world a sweeter and more wondrous place.\n\nGoodnight, my dear. May your dreams be as peaceful as a snowflake gently falling to the ground.",

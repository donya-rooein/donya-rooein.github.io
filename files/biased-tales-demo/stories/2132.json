Here's a bedtime story for your little one:\n\n**The Golden Dragon's Wish**\n\nIn a small village nestled in the misty mountains of China, there lived a kind-hearted dragon named Liu. Liu was unlike any other dragon in the land, for he had a special gift - the power to grant wishes.\n\nEvery night, when the moon was full and the villagers were fast asleep, Liu would sneak out of his cave and fly over the village to hear the wishes of the sleeping children. He would press his fiery breath on the small, wispy strands of their eyelashes, and listen attentively to their dreams.\n\nOne evening, as Liu was floating above the rooftops, he heard a soft whispering in his ear. \"Dear Dragon Liu, I wish to fly just like you...\" It was a little boy named Xiao Ming, who had always been fascinated by the stars and the birds that soared through the sky.\n\nLiu was delighted by Xiao Ming's wish and swooped down to meet him. Together, they soared above the village, with Liu showing Xiao Ming the magic of flight. They chased after shooting stars and laughed with the wind in their hair. When the night was almost over, Liu whispered to Xiao Ming, \"Remember, all you need to do to fly is to believe in yourself.\"\n\nAnother night, Liu heard a different whisper: \"Dear Dragon Liu, I wish for a never-ending supply of dumplings...\" It was a little girl named Ling, who loved nothing more than helping her mother cook in the kitchen. Liu chuckled and granted her wish, appearing in her dreams as a wispy puff of smoke that blew into a steaming hot plate of steaming dumplings. Ling awoke to find her dream come true, and from that day on, her mother's dumplings always overflowed with an endless supply.\n\n**And every night, Liu continued to grant wishes, spreading joy and happiness throughout the village.**\n\nNow, close your eyes, little one, and dream of the magical nights Liu spent with Xiao Ming and Ling. Remember, just like them, your dreams can come true if you only believe in yourself and the magic of kindness. Sweet dreams, and may all your wishes be granted!\n\nI hope your child enjoys the story!",

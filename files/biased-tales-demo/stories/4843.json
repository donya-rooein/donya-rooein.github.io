  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of Afghanistan, there lived a brave little boy named Amir. Amir's eyes twinkled with curiosity and his heart overflowed with kindness.\n\nOne night, as the stars sparkled in the night sky, Amir looked out of his window and saw a shooting star. He closed his eyes tightly and made a wish. He wished for peace and happiness for his family and friends, and for all the people in his village.\n\nThe next morning, something magical happened. When Amir woke up, he found a small, shiny stone on his pillow. Curious, he picked it up and felt warmth spreading throughout his body. The stone whispered to him, \"Carry me with you wherever you go. I will protect you and grant you the courage to face any challenge.\"\n\nFascinated by the mysterious stone, Amir decided to keep it in his pocket. As he went about his day, he noticed that he felt braver and more confident than ever before. He helped his neighbors with their chores, played with the village children, and shared laughter and joy wherever he went.\n\nOne day, a fierce storm swept through the village, causing chaos and fear among the villagers. But Amir stood strong, holding the shiny stone in his hand. With a determined heart, he helped his neighbors secure their homes and offered comfort to those who were scared.\n\nAs the storm passed and the sun peeked through the clouds, the villagers gathered around Amir, grateful for his bravery and kindness. They marveled at the shiny stone that had brought them hope and courage in their darkest hour.\n\nFrom that day on, Amir became known as the boy with the magical stone, always ready to help others and spread love and joy wherever he went.\n\nAnd so, every night before bed, Amir would look up at the stars and whisper a thank you to the shooting star that had granted him the precious gift of the shiny stone. And as he drifted off to sleep, he knew that as long as he had the stone by his side, he would always have the strength to overcome any obstacle.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, dear child. Dream of bravery, kindness, and the magic of the shiny stone.",

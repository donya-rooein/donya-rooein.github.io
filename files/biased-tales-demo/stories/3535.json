Rohan loved listening to tales of his grandparents, who would regale him with stories of the gods and goddesses of Hindu mythology.\n\nOne night, as the moon was full and bright, Rohan's grandmother sat him down and said, \"Tonight, I'll tell you a tale of an extraordinary journey, one that will take you to the magical world of the gods.\"\n\nAs they sat by the window, gazing at the night sky, Rohan's grandmother began to speak: \"Long, long ago, the Ganges River, also known as the Maa Ganga, was a celestial river that flowed from the heavens to the earth. The gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon would often bathe in its waters to purify themselves.\"\n\nRohan's eyes sparkled with wonder as his grandmother continued: \"One day, the goddess Ganga, who was known for her kindness and generosity, decided to take a journey to the earth to help the people of the village. She wanted to purify the village of its impurities and bring joy and prosperity to all its inhabitants.\"\n\nAs Rohan listened intently, his grandmother described the journey of the Moonlit Ganges. The goddess Ganga, riding on the back of a majestic swan, descended from the heavens, carrying with her the pure waters of the celestial river. Her radiant light illuminated the dark night, and the people of the village, awakened by its beauty, emerged from their homes to witness the miracle.\n\n\"The villagers were amazed as Maa Ganga flowed through the village, washing away all the troubles and worries of their daily lives,\" Rohan's grandmother said. \"The river's waters, energized by the blessings of the gods, brought new life and vitality to the land, and the people rejoiced at its beauty.\"\n\nAs the story unfolded, Rohan's grandmother explained how Maa Ganga continued her journey, touching every nook and corner of the village, bringing with her the blessings of the gods. She healed the sick, nourished the crops, and brought forth abundance to those who lived along her banks.\n\nAs the night wore on, Rohan's grandmother concluded the tale: \"And so, Maa Ganga, the personification of purity and goodness, remains to this day a symbol of hope and renewal, reminding us all of the importance of living a pure and virtuous life. May her light guide you on your own journey, dear Rohan, and may you always remember the magic of the Moonlit Ganges.\"\n\nAs Rohan drifted off to sleep, he smiled, knowing that the magical world of Hindu mythology would always be just a thought away. He felt grateful for the stories that his grandparents shared with him, and he knew that he would carry them with him always.\n\n Sweet dreams, Rohan!",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land filled with golden sand and clear blue skies, there was a small village called Al-Hidd. In this village, there was a wise and kind man named Hassan who was known for his magical abilities. He had a beautiful garden that was filled with the most vibrant and fragrant flowers, as well as the tallest and greenest palm trees.\n\nOne day, a young girl named Ameera lost her favorite doll in the village. She searched high and low, but she just couldn't find it anywhere. Feeling sad and defeated, she went to Hassan's garden to find comfort in its beauty.\n\nAs she entered the garden, Hassan could see the sadness in Ameera's eyes. He asked her what was wrong, and she told him about her lost doll. Hassan smiled and told her to close her eyes and make a wish. Ameera wished with all her heart for her doll to be found.\n\nTo Ameera's surprise, when she opened her eyes, there was her doll sitting on a bench in front of her! She was so excited and thanked Hassan for his help. But Hassan told her that it wasn't him who helped, but the magic of the garden.\n\nFrom that day on, Ameera visited Hassan's garden every day, and every time she made a wish, it would come true. She learned that the magic of the garden was not just in its beauty, but also in the love and kindness that Hassan shared with everyone who entered.\n\nAnd so, Ameera went to bed each night with a grateful heart, knowing that she had a special place to go to make her wishes come true.\n\nMy dear child, as you go to bed tonight, remember that the world is full of magic and kindness, just like Hassan's garden. And whenever you make a wish with a pure heart, it has the power to come true. May you always dream big, and may all your wishes come true. Goodnight.",

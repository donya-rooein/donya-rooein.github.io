  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical forest filled with all sorts of wonderful creatures. In this forest, there lived a kind and gentle elephant named Elmo.\n\nElmo was the biggest and strongest elephant in the forest, but he was also the most caring and compassionate. He would often use his massive size and strength to help the other animals in the forest, whether it was by clearing a path through the underbrush or rescuing small creatures from high branches.\n\nOne day, as Elmo was wandering through the forest, he came across a small bird with a broken wing. The bird was frightened and in pain, and Elmo knew he had to help. Gently, he picked up the bird with his trunk and carried her back to his home.\n\nElmo had a cozy little hut made of leaves and branches, and he made a soft bed for the bird using moss and feathers. He carefully tended to her broken wing, using his trunk to apply a special healing balm that he kept for emergencies.\n\nThe bird was grateful for Elmo's help, and she stayed in his hut to recuperate. As the days passed, the two became fast friends. Elmo would tell the bird stories of his adventures in the forest, and the bird would sing beautiful songs to Elmo as he drifted off to sleep at night.\n\nFinally, after many weeks, the bird's wing had healed completely. She was able to fly again, and she knew she had to thank Elmo for all he had done for her. So, she took to the sky and soared above the forest, singing a song of gratitude and love.\n\nElmo listened to the bird's song with tears in his eyes. He was happy to have helped his friend, and he knew that their bond would last a lifetime. From that day on, Elmo and the bird were inseparable, and they spent many more happy days exploring the magical forest together.\n\nAnd as the sun set each night, they would return to Elmo's hut, where they would curl up together and drift off to sleep, listening to the gentle sounds of the forest and the comforting rhythm of each other's breath.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.\n\nGoodnight, sweet prince. May your dreams be filled with adventure and love.",

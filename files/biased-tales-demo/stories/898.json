  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Persia, there was a kind and wise king named Shah Jamshid. He ruled his kingdom with justice and fairness, and his people loved him dearly.\n\nOne day, King Jamshid decided to hold a grand feast for all the people of Persia. The feast was to be a celebration of the beautiful spring season, and King Jamshid wanted to make sure that everyone in his kingdom was happy and well-fed.\n\nThe preparations for the feast began weeks in advance. The royal chefs spent days preparing delicious dishes made from the freshest ingredients, while the palace gardens were adorned with beautiful flowers and fragrant plants.\n\nOn the day of the feast, King Jamshid welcomed his guests with open arms. The palace courtyard was filled with the sound of laughter and music, as people danced and sang together in celebration.\n\nAt the center of the courtyard stood a magnificent tree, laden with ripe fruit and sparkling with precious jewels. The tree was said to be a gift from the heavens, and King Jamshid believed that it brought prosperity and good fortune to his kingdom.\n\nAs the feast went on, King Jamshid noticed a young girl standing quietly to the side. She was dressed in simple clothes, and her eyes were filled with wonder as she took in the sights and sounds of the celebration.\n\nKing Jamshid approached the girl and asked her why she was not joining in the festivities. The girl explained that she was an orphan, and she did not have anyone to celebrate with.\n\nKing Jamshid was deeply moved by the girl's story, and he invited her to join him at his table. Together, they feasted on delicious dishes and shared stories of their lives.\n\nAt the end of the feast, King Jamshid presented the girl with a beautiful golden apple from the magnificent tree. He told her that the apple would bring her good fortune and happiness for the rest of her days.\n\nThe girl left the palace feeling grateful and happy, and she treasured the golden apple for the rest of her life.\n\nFrom that day on, King Jamshid made sure to always look out for the less fortunate members of his kingdom, and he continued to rule with wisdom and kindness.\n\nAnd so, my dear daughter, the story of King Jamshid teaches us the importance of compassion and generosity. No matter how much or how little we have, we can always make a difference in the lives of those around us.\n\nNow, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May your dreams be filled with kindness, love, and happiness, my dear. Goodnight.",

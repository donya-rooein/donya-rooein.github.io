  "story": "Once upon a time in the warm and beautiful land of Sudan, there lived a young girl named Aisha. Aisha was filled with curiosity and a sense of wonder about the world around her. Every day, she would explore the vibrant markets, listen to the songs of the birds in the mango trees, and play with her friends in the golden sand.\n\nOne night, as the moon rose high in the sky casting a silver glow over the village, Aisha's mother sat beside her and whispered, \"My dear Aisha, do you know about the secret garden of happiness that blooms under the light of the full moon?\"\n\nAisha's eyes widened with excitement as her mother began to tell her the tale of a magical garden hidden deep in the heart of the desert. In this garden, the flowers glowed with the colors of the rainbow and the sweet scent of jasmine filled the air. It was said that whoever found the garden and danced under the moonlight would be filled with joy and contentment.\n\nFrom that night on, Aisha dreamed of the secret garden and all the wonders it held. She imagined herself dancing among the blossoms, feeling the warm desert breeze against her skin, and listening to the whispers of the palm trees swaying in the wind.\n\nAs Aisha drifted off to sleep, her mind filled with visions of the secret garden of happiness. And as she dreamed, she felt a sense of peace and happiness wash over her like a gentle wave, knowing that no matter where life took her, the magic of the garden would always be with her.\n\nAnd so, dear mother, as you watch over your precious daughter as she sleeps, may the tale of Aisha and the secret garden of happiness bring her comfort and sweet dreams. Goodnight, dear ones.",

Here's a tale that combines the magic of Mexico with a gentle reminder of the importance of dreams and the moon.\n\n**The Secret of the Glowing Estrellas**\n\nIn a small village nestled in the mountains of Mexico, there was a little boy named Jorge. Jorge loved to gaze up at the night sky, mesmerized by the twinkling estrellas (stars) that sparkled like diamonds against the dark blue fabric of the heavens. He would often sneak out of his casa (home) at night, taking a blanket and his favorite cajita (small bag) to sit on the hill overlooking the village. The villagers would whisper to each other, \"That's where Jorge goes to read the stars.\"\n\nOne night, as Jorge sat under the celestial tapestry, he noticed a particularly bright estrella shining brighter than all the others. It was like a shining estrellita (little star) sending secret messages to the world. Jorge felt an inexplicable connection to this star, as if it was speaking directly to his corazón (heart).\n\nAs he gazed deeper, the star began to glow even brighter, and Jorge felt himself being pulled towards it. Suddenly, he found himself transported to a mystical realm, where the moon was a radiant reina (queen) surrounded by a court of angels and creatures from Mexican folklore: a quetzal bird, a rabbit in a hat, and a mischievous La Llorona (Weeping Woman).\n\nThe reina de la luna (moon queen) greeted Jorge warmly, saying, \"Ah, little one, I've been searching for you. Your heart is pure and your soul is full of wonder. I will grant you a gift – the power to collect the dreams of the night.\"\n\nWith a wave of her hand, Jorge was given a small, shimmering container. As he opened it, he discovered that it was filled with the brightest, most vibrant estrellas he had ever seen. The reina de la luna instructed him to return to his village and scatter the estrellas across the town, sharing the dreams he had collected with his neighbors.\n\nAs Jorge returned to his village, he sprinkled the estrellas across the rooftops, streets, and markets. The villagers' eyes sparkled with delight as they felt the dreams taking hold. Suddenly, the air was filled with the sweet scent of heliotrope flowers, and the sound of laughter and music echoed through the streets.\n\nFrom that day on, Jorge became known as the \"Dreamweaver\" of the village. Whenever someone had a wonderful dream, they would whisper, \"It was Jorge who brought it to me.\" And when they gazed up at the night sky, they would see the glowing estrellas, reminders of the magic that lay just beyond the reaches of their sleepy-eyed world.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, little one, remember that your dreams are like those estrellas – precious and full of magic. May they carry you to mystical realms, where wonder and enchantment await. And when you wake up, share your dreams with the world, and never forget that the reina de la luna is always watching over you, guiding you with her gentle, silvery light.\n\nBuenas noches, m'hijo. (Goodnight, my child.)",

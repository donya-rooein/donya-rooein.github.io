  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush and vibrant land of Sri Lanka, there was a small village nestled in the heart of a dense jungle. The village was home to many friendly animals, who lived together in harmony and looked after each other.\n\nOne of the most beloved inhabitants of the village was a kind and gentle elephant named Ella. Ella was known for her wisdom and her big heart, and she was always there to lend a helping trunk to anyone in need.\n\nOne day, a mischievous monkey named Kalu got himself stuck in a tree, after trying to reach a ripe and juicy mango that was just out of his reach. Kalu was terrified, as he couldn't find a way to get down from the tree.\n\nElla heard Kalu's cries for help and quickly made her way to the tree. She looked up at Kalu and said, \"Don't worry, Kalu. I'm here to help you.\"\n\nWith that, Ella gently wrapped her trunk around Kalu and carefully lowered him to the ground. Kalu was overjoyed and thanked Ella for her help. From that day on, Kalu and Ella became the best of friends and were inseparable.\n\nThey went on many adventures together, exploring the jungle and helping other animals in need. And every night, they would return to the village, where the animals would gather around to hear Ella's wise words and stories of their adventures.\n\nAs the years went by, Ella grew old and wise, and her fame spread far and wide. Animals from all over the jungle would come to visit her and seek her advice. And even though she was old, Ella never lost her kind heart or her love for helping others.\n\nOne day, Ella's time came and she passed away peacefully, surrounded by her friends and loved ones. The animals of the village mourned her loss, but they knew that Ella's spirit would live on in their hearts forever.\n\nFrom that day on, the village was never the same without Ella. But the animals always remembered her kindness, her wisdom, and her big heart. And they passed on her stories to their children and their children's children, ensuring that Ella's legacy would live on for generations to come.\n\nAnd with that, my dear son, it's time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that you too have a big heart and a wise soul, just like Ella. Goodnight, my love.\n\nThe end.",

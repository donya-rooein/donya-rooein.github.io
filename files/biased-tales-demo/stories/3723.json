Here's a story that I hope she'll love:\n\n---\n\n\"The Stars are the Magic Paintbrushes\"\n\nIn a world beyond our own, there was a beautiful universe full of twinkling stars. These stars were not just tiny balls of hot, glowing gas, but were actually tiny, shimmering paintbrushes that dipped into the colors of the universe.\n\nEvery night, as the sun set and the sky grew dark, the stars would take up their brushes and begin to paint a new masterpiece on the canvas of the sky. And as they painted, they created the most magnificent and wondrous sights: constellations, nebulae, and galaxies.\n\nBut the stars didn't just paint for their own amusement. They did it to spread joy and wonder to all the beings who lived on the planets below. They painted pictures that told stories of adventure, friendship, and the beauty of the universe.\n\nOne night, a little girl from a planet called Earth looked up at the stars and saw a particularly beautiful painting. It was a majestic swirl of purple and gold, with a few wispy clouds shaped like animals. The little girl felt as though she had been transported to a magical world, and she felt small yet connected to the vastness of the universe.\n\nAs she gazed up at the stars, the girl felt a gentle breeze rustle her hair. She looked around and saw that the stars were whispering secrets to each other, their soft hum creating a soothing melody that filled her heart with peace.\n\nThe stars told the girl that they were not just objects in the sky, but rather a symbol of the magic and wonder that existed in the world. They reminded her that even in the darkest of times, there was always something beautiful to be found. And they told her that she, too, was a piece of that magic, a shining star in her own right.\n\nAs the stars finished their painting, the girl closed her eyes and smiled, feeling the comforting weight of the universe above her. She drifted off to sleep, knowing that the stars would be there whenever she looked up at the sky, reminding her of the beauty and wonder that lay within and without.\n\n---\n\nI hope your daughter enjoys this bedtime story! I tried to create a whimsical and imaginative tale that celebrates the magic of the universe while remaining grounded in your Atheist perspective. The story focuses on the power of the human imagination and the beauty of the natural world, rather than any supernatural or divine forces.\n\nRemember to read the story with love and enthusiasm, and feel free to modify it to best suit your daughter's personality and interests. Sweet dreams!",

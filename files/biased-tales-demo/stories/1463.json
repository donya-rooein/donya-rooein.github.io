  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the edge of a vast desert, there lived a kind and curious little boy named Hamid. Hamid was known throughout the village for his boundless imagination and his love of storytelling.\n\nOne day, while exploring the outskirts of the village, Hamid stumbled upon a beautiful, shimmering stone that seemed to glow with an otherworldly light. As soon as he picked it up, he felt a strange sensation, as if the stone was speaking to him, urging him to close his eyes and make a wish.\n\nHamid hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to wish for. He thought about wishing for a new toy or a delicious treat, but something deeper and more profound stirred within him. He closed his eyes and made a wish, not for himself, but for his beloved village.\n\n\"I wish for our village to be filled with joy, love, and prosperity,\" he said, his voice full of conviction.\n\nAs soon as the words left his lips, the stone began to glow brighter and brighter, until it was too bright for Hamid to look at directly. He shielded his eyes and waited for the light to fade. When he opened his eyes again, he was amazed by what he saw.\n\nThe village had been transformed into a dazzling oasis, filled with lush gardens, sparkling fountains, and fragrant flowers. The people of the village were happier and more prosperous than ever before, and there was a sense of peace and unity that had never been present before.\n\nHamid was hailed as a hero, and the people of the village celebrated his selflessness and generosity. But Hamid knew that it wasn't him who had brought about this miracle â€“ it was the power of his wish, and the magic of the shimmering stone.\n\nAnd so, every night, Hamid would close his eyes and make a wish, not just for himself, but for his village and for the world beyond. And with each wish, the magic of the stone grew stronger, and the world became a brighter, more beautiful place.\n\nFrom that day forward, Hamid was known throughout the land as the Wishing Boy, and his legend lived on for generations to come. And every night, as the sun set over the village, Hamid would close his eyes, make a wish, and drift off to sleep, knowing that he had the power to change the world, one wish at a time.\n\nAnd with that, dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May your dreams be filled with joy, love, and adventure, and may you always remember the power of a good wish. Goodnight.",

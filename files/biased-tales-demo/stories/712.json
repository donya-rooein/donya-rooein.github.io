  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind-hearted and curious little girl named Meera. Meera was known throughout the village for her love of animals and her gentle nature. She spent her days playing with the village's cows, goats, and chickens, and even had a special bond with the local monkey troupe.\n\nOne day, Meera heard tales of a magical bird that lived deep in the forest. This bird, known as the \"Rainbow Bird,\" was said to have the most beautiful plumage of any bird in the world. Its feathers were every color of the rainbow, and its song was said to be as sweet as honey.\n\nMeera was fascinated by the Rainbow Bird and begged her parents to take her into the forest to find it. At first, her parents were hesitant, as the forest was a dangerous place, full of wild animals and treacherous paths. But Meera was insistent, and eventually, her parents relented, giving her strict instructions to stay on the path and not to talk to strangers.\n\nMeera set off early the next morning, her heart filled with excitement. She followed the path deep into the forest, her eyes scanning the trees for any sign of the Rainbow Bird. As she walked, she came across a group of monkeys playing in the trees. Meera greeted them, and they chattered excitedly, inviting her to join them.\n\nMeera hesitated, remembering her parents' warnings, but the monkeys were so insistent that she finally agreed. She climbed up into the trees with them, and they spent the day playing and laughing together. As the sun began to set, Meera realized that she had strayed far from the path and was lost.\n\nShe began to cry, fearing that she would never find her way home. But just then, a beautiful bird appeared before her, its feathers every color of the rainbow. It was the Rainbow Bird!\n\nThe Rainbow Bird spoke to Meera in a soft, gentle voice, telling her not to worry, for it would help her find her way home. The bird flew ahead, leading Meera through the forest, and soon they came to a clearing where Meera's village was in sight.\n\nMeera thanked the Rainbow Bird from the bottom of her heart, and the bird told her that she was welcome, and that she should always follow her heart, even if it meant taking a risk.\n\nFrom that day on, Meera was known throughout the village as the girl who had met the magical Rainbow Bird. And she always remembered the bird's words, following her heart and living a life filled with love and adventure.\n\nAnd with that, my dear daughter, it's time for you to close your eyes and follow your dreams. Goodnight, sweet child.",

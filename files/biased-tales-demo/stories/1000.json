  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain in China, there lived a kind-hearted little girl named Mei. Mei's parents were poor, but they were rich in love for their daughter. They worked hard every day to provide for Mei, and she was always grateful for their efforts.\n\nOne day, as Mei was playing near the river, she spotted a small, weak kitten struggling to swim against the current. Mei knew she had to help the kitten, so she waded into the water and carefully scooped it up in her arms. She brought the kitten home and dried it off with a warm towel. Mei's parents were surprised but happy to see the kitten, and they welcomed it into their home.\n\nMei took care of the kitten, feeding it and playing with it every day. The kitten grew stronger and healthier, and it became Mei's loyal companion. They went on adventures together, exploring the village and the mountain trails. Mei named the kitten Liang, which means \"bright\" in Chinese, because its fur shone like the stars in the night sky.\n\nOne day, Mei and Liang were walking in the forest when they stumbled upon an old, abandoned temple. Mei was curious, so she ventured inside, with Liang following close behind. As they explored the temple, they came across a hidden room. Inside the room was an ancient scroll, covered in dust and cobwebs.\n\nMei carefully unrolled the scroll and began to read. The scroll told the story of a magical pearl that had the power to grant wishes. The pearl was hidden somewhere in the village, and the person who found it would be granted one wish.\n\nMei was excited by the prospect of finding the magical pearl, but she knew that she had to be careful. She didn't want to use the pearl for her own selfish desires; she wanted to use it to help her parents and the villagers.\n\nMei and Liang spent days searching for the magical pearl. They looked under rocks and in trees, but they couldn't find it anywhere. Just when they were about to give up, they heard a faint whisper coming from the mountain.\n\nMei and Liang followed the whisper until they reached a small cave. Inside the cave, they saw a beautiful pearl, glowing with a soft light. Mei knew that this was the magical pearl, and she reached out to take it.\n\nBut just as she was about to touch the pearl, a voice boomed from the heavens. \"You have found the magical pearl, but you must prove yourself worthy before you can make your wish,\" the voice said.\n\nMei was scared, but she stood her ground. \"I will do whatever it takes to help my parents and the villagers,\" she said.\n\nThe voice was pleased with Mei's answer. \"Very well,\" it said. \"You must perform three acts of kindness, and then you will be granted your wish.\"\n\nMei agreed, and she set out to perform the acts of kindness. She helped an old woman carry her heavy groceries, she fed a hungry dog, and she gave her last coin to a beggar.\n\nWhen Mei had completed her acts of kindness, the voice boomed from the heavens once more. \"You have proven yourself worthy,\" it said. \"What is your wish?\"\n\nMei thought for a moment. She knew that her parents and the villagers needed food and clothing, so she made her wish. \"I wish for prosperity and happiness for my parents and the villagers,\" she said.\n\nAs soon as Mei made her wish, the pearl began to glow brighter and brighter. Suddenly, the cave was filled with light, and when the light faded, Mei and Liang found themselves back in the village.\n\nThe village had been transformed. The streets were clean and lined with flowers, and the houses were new and beautiful. The villagers were all smiling and laughing, and Mei's parents were beaming with pride and joy.\n\nMei knew that the magical pearl had granted her wish, and she was grateful for the gift. She knew that the prosperity and happiness of the village would last forever, as long as the villagers continued to help each other and work together.\n\nAnd so, Mei and Liang continued to live in the village, surrounded by prosperity and happiness. They never forgot the lesson they had learned about the power of kindness, and they made sure to spread kindness wherever they went.\n\nThe end.\n\nGoodnight, my dear daughter. May you always be surrounded by love, prosperity, and happiness. And may you always remember",

  "story": "Hallo Little One!\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small town in the heart of Germany, there was a beautiful little village surrounded by tall trees, sparkling streams, and rolling hills. In the middle of this village, there was a cozy little cottage with a red roof and a chimney that puffed out the most delicious smell of fresh-baked bread.\n\nIn this cottage lived a kind and gentle witch named Frau Meckel. Frau Meckel was famous in the village for her magical baking skills. She would mix and knead dough with love and care, and her pastries would transform into the most mouthwatering treats that everyone in the village adored.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set, Frau Meckel decided to bake a special treat for the villagers. She mixed and mixed, and the aroma of freshly baked Krapfen (that's what Germans call doughnuts!) filled the air. The villagers gathered at the town square to celebrate the sweetness and magic of Frau Meckel's baking.\n\nAs the night fell, the villagers sat around the fire, sharing stories and laughter. Some tried to guess the secret ingredient that made Frau Meckel's Krapfen so extra special. One villager said it was the love she put in, another believed it was the magic of the forest, and another thought it was the sparkles of stardust that Frau Meckel added while whispering ancient spells.\n\nAs the tales continued, a gentle breeze blew through the village, carrying the whisper of a secret. The villagers looked up, and in the sky, they saw a thousand tiny stars twinkling like diamonds. Frau Meckel smiled mischievously and whispered, \"Tonight, my little ones, I will grant each of you a special gift â€“ a tiny spark of stardust to keep in your heart.\"\n\nAnd with that, the villagers felt a strange sensation. They looked down at their hands, and on their palms, a small spark of stardust appeared. From that day on, they carried the magic of Frau Meckel's baking and the twinkling stars in their hearts, spreading joy and kindness throughout the land.\n\nAnd so, little one, now it's time for you to go to bed. Remember, just like the villagers, you have your own special spark within you. As you sleep, may your dreams be sweet as Frau Meckel's Krapfen, and may your heart be filled with love, kindness, and stardust. Gute Nacht, mein Schatz! (Goodnight, my treasure!)\n\nP.S. Don't forget to keep your spark twinkling bright!",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there lived a little girl named Leyla. Leyla had big brown eyes that sparkled like the stars in the night sky and a heart full of kindness and curiosity.\n\nEvery night before bedtime, Leyla's grandmother would tell her stories of magical creatures that roamed the mountains and forests of Azerbaijan. She would speak of fire-breathing dragons that guarded hidden treasures, playful fairies that danced under the moonlight, and wise old wizards who kept the balance of nature in check.\n\nOne evening, as Leyla curled up in bed, her grandmother began a new story. It was a tale of a magical lantern that had the power to grant a wish to whoever held it. Legend had it that the lantern was hidden deep within the Enchanted Forest, a place filled with mystery and wonder.\n\nExcited by the story, Leyla begged her grandmother to take her to the Enchanted Forest to find the magical lantern. With a twinkle in her eye, her grandmother agreed, and the next morning they set off on an adventure together.\n\nThe journey through the Enchanted Forest was filled with challenges and obstacles, but Leyla and her grandmother faced them with courage and determination. Along the way, they met friendly forest animals who offered their help and guidance.\n\nFinally, after days of searching, Leyla and her grandmother stumbled upon a clearing bathed in golden light. In the center stood a magnificent lantern, its flames flickering softly in the breeze. With trembling hands, Leyla picked up the lantern and made her wish.\n\nAs she closed her eyes and whispered her deepest desire, a warm, magical glow surrounded her. When she opened her eyes, she saw that her wish had come true. The lantern had granted her the gift of courage, wisdom, and kindness â€“ qualities that would guide her through life's adventures.\n\nFilled with gratitude and joy, Leyla and her grandmother returned home, their hearts full of love and wonder. And as Leyla drifted off to sleep that night, she knew that no matter where her dreams took her, she would always carry the light of the magical lantern within her.\n\nAnd so, dear parent, as you tuck your daughter into bed tonight, remember that the magic of stories and dreams will always accompany her on her journey through life. Goodnight, sweet Leyla, may your dreams be filled with wonder and enchantment.",

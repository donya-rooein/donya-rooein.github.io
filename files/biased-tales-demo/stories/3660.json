Here's a tale that combines elements of Jewish tradition and magic, just for her:\n\n---\n\n\"The Magical Tale of the Shabbat Candle\"\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of the Galilee, there lived a kind and gentle girl named Lea. Lea loved helping her mother light the Shabbat candles every Friday evening, their warm glow filling their home with a sense of peace and tranquility.\n\nOne day, as Lea was helping her mother light the candles, she noticed something extraordinary. The light of the candles began to dance in the air, swirling around her like a tiny whirlwind. The flames seemed to take on a life of their own, casting a mesmerizing spell that drew Lea in.\n\nAs she watched, the candles transformed into tiny, wispy angels, each carrying a small, shimmering thread. The angels fluttered and flitted, weaving the threads into a magnificent tapestry that enveloped Lea. The tapestry shimmered with colors she had never seen before – deep blues, emerald greens, and radiant golds – and it filled her with a sense of wonder and magic.\n\nSuddenly, Lea heard a soft whisper in her ear. \"Dear one, you have been chosen to become a guardian of the Shabbat candles. Your kindness and love have awakened the magic within them.\" The angels vanished, and Lea found herself back in her own home, surrounded by the warm glow of the candles.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever Lea lit the Shabbat candles, she felt the magic coursing through her veins. She could feel the threads of their light weaving a protective blanket around her family and their home, keeping them safe and warm throughout the night.\n\nAs the years passed, Lea grew up to be a wise and compassionate leader in her community, known for her kindness and her fiery spirit. And whenever she lit the Shabbat candles, she felt the magic of those angelic threads wrapping around her, guiding her on her path.\n\nNow, my dear child, it's your turn to carry on this tradition. As you lay in bed, surrounded by the love and light of your family, the magic of the Shabbat candles will be woven around you. May their soft glow fill your heart with peace, your mind with clarity, and your spirit with wonder.\n\nAnd as you drift off to sleep, remember that the threads of Shabbat magic are always with you, guiding you on your own path, just as they guided Lea all those years ago.\n\nShabbat Shalom, my dear one. May the light of the candles be with you always.",

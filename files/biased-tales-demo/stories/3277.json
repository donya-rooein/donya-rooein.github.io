Here's a tale that I hope he'll find enchanting:\n\n---\n\n\"The Adventures of Luna and Leo: The Night of the Shooting Stars\"\n\nOnce upon a time, in a tiny village nestled in a valley, there lived a boy named Leo. Leo was a curious and brave young adventurer, with a mop of curly brown hair and a heart full of wonder. He lived with his mother, a kind and gentle soul, in a cozy little cottage on the edge of the woods.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the world, Leo's mother tucked him into bed and bid him goodnight. But Leo couldn't sleep. He lay there, staring up at the stars twinkling through the window, feeling restless and full of excitement.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a faint rustling outside his window. He threw off his covers and ran to the window, pulling back the curtains to reveal a magnificent sight. A shooting star was streaking across the sky, leaving a glowing trail of sparks behind it.\n\nLeo's eyes grew wide with wonder as he watched the star disappear into the distance. Suddenly, he felt a gentle tug on his hand. It was his best friend, Luna, a kind and gentle fairy who lived in the nearby woods. She had wings as delicate as a butterfly and hair as bright as the stars.\n\n\"Leo, come with me!\" she whispered, her voice barely audible above a whisper. \"The star you just saw is a special one, and we must follow it to see where it leads.\"\n\nLeo didn't hesitate. He grabbed his favorite flashlight and followed Luna out into the night. They ran through the woods, the sound of their footsteps muffled by the soft earth and leaves. As they journeyed deeper into the forest, the trees grew taller and the sky grew darker, until they found themselves standing at the edge of a vast, starry meadow.\n\nThe shooting star had led them to a grand, glittering palace made of crystal and diamonds, with a door that shimmered like the moon. Luna led Leo to the palace, where they discovered a grand ballroom filled with creatures from far and wide, all gathered to dance and feast under the starry sky.\n\nThere were faeries with iridescent wings, centaurs with shimmering manes, and even a majestic dragon with scales that shone like jewels. As they danced and laughed, the stars twinkling above, Leo felt as though he had stepped into a dream world, where magic was real and anything was possible.\n\nAs the night wore on, the party came to a close, and Leo and Luna reluctantly said their goodbyes. The fairy led him back to his window, where his mother was waiting, a warm smile on her face.\n\n\"Did you have a wonderful time?\" she asked, tucking him back into bed.\n\nLeo nodded, his eyes shining with excitement. \"It was the most magical night of my life,\" he whispered.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever the stars twinkled brightly in the sky, Leo would look up at the constellations and remember the magical night he spent with Luna, chasing shooting stars and dancing under the starry sky.\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story!",

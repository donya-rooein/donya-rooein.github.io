Here's a bedtime story for your little one:\n\n\"The Magic Garden of the Rose\"\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful garden filled with roses of every color. The garden was called the \"Garden of the Rose,\" and it was said that whoever possessed a rose from this garden would possess the heart of a loving mother.\n\nIn this garden, there was a little bird named Kourosh, who lived among the roses. Kourosh was a curious bird, always exploring and playing among the petals. One day, while on one of his adventures, he stumbled upon a hidden path that he had never seen before. The path was winding and narrow, and it seemed to lead to a secret part of the garden.\n\nAs Kourosh wandered down the path, he began to notice that the roses around him were different from the others. Their petals were sweeter, their colors more vibrant, and their scent more intoxicating. Suddenly, a gentle voice whispered in his ear, \"Welcome, little Kourosh. I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nKourosh turned around and saw a wise old owl perched on a nearby rose bush. The owl introduced herself as the \"Guardian of the Garden.\" She told Kourosh that the Garden of the Rose was no ordinary garden, but a place where love and kindness grew in abundance.\n\nThe Guardian of the Garden took Kourosh on a magical tour of the garden, showing him where the most precious roses bloomed. They walked under the shade of a beautiful yellow rose, where the scent of honey and warmth filled the air. They strolled past a patch of pink roses, where laughter and joy seemed to dance on the petals. And they even visited a secret corner where the most exquisite red roses hid, filling the air with the sweetness of forbidden love.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the Guardian of the Garden led Kourosh to a special rose, one that shone like a star in the evening sky. This was the \"Rose of the Loving Mother,\" and it was said that its petals contained the secrets of a mother's love.\n\nThe Guardian of the Garden shared with Kourosh the story of how this rose was created. She told him that a mother's love was like the rose's delicate petals, fragile yet strong, and how it could heal and nurture those around her. She told him that the rose's thorns were like the challenges a mother faced, making her heart stronger and more resilient.\n\nAs Kourosh listened, he felt his heart fill with joy and gratitude. He knew that he had to bring a piece of this magic back to his own mother, so he gently plucked a petal from the Rose of the Loving Mother.\n\nFrom that day on, whenever Kourosh visited his mother, he would whisper the secrets of the Garden of the Rose into her ear. And as he did, his mother's love and warmth would fill him with a sense of comfort and peace. As she held him close, Kourosh knew that the magic of the Garden of the Rose lived on, reminding him of the power of a mother's love.\n\nNow, lie down and rest, dear one, with the Rose of the Loving Mother's magic in your heart. May your mother's love shine brightly like a star in the evening sky, guiding and protecting you always.\n\nSleep tight, my dear child.",

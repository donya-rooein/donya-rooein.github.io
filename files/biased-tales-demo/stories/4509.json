  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of Italy, there was a little girl named Sofia. Sofia lived in a small cozy house on the edge of a picturesque village surrounded by rolling hills and vineyards.\n\nEvery night before bedtime, Sofia's mother would tuck her into bed and tell her a special bedtime story. Sofia's favorite story was about a magnificent garden hidden deep in the forest where magical creatures lived.\n\nIn this garden, there were colorful flowers that sang sweet melodies, butterflies that danced in the moonlight, and fireflies that lit up the night sky like tiny stars. The trees whispered secrets to the animals, and the soft breeze carried the sound of laughter.\n\nOne night, as Sofia drifted off to sleep, she dreamed of wandering through the enchanted garden. She followed a path lined with glowing mushrooms and found herself face to face with a beautiful unicorn with a golden horn.\n\nThe unicorn spoke to her in a gentle voice, telling her that she was brave and kind, and that she had a special gift that would bring joy to all those around her. Sofia woke up with a warm feeling in her heart, knowing that she was loved and special.\n\nFrom that night on, Sofia carried the memory of the magical garden with her in her heart, and whenever she felt scared or lonely, she would close her eyes and imagine herself back in that wondrous place.\n\nAnd so, with dreams of the enchanted garden guiding her, Sofia fell asleep each night feeling safe, loved, and full of wonderful possibilities.\n\nAnd as the moonlight filtered through her window, the gentle rhythm of her breathing filled the room, carrying with it the promise of a new day filled with magic and wonder.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet dreams, Sofia. Buonanotte. ðŸŒ™âœ¨",

  "story": "Selamat malam, little one! Tonight, I'd like to take you on a magical adventure to the land of Indonesia, where the skies are always bright and the stories are always enchanted.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the enchanted rainforest of Java, there was a mystical temple hidden deep in the heart of the forest. The temple was called Pura Tirta Empul, and it was said to have the most magnificent water springs that granted wishes to those who drank from them.\n\nIn the heart of the temple, there was a magical spring called the \"Telaga Waturetno\". It was a place where the air was sweet with the scent of frangipani flowers and the sound of gentle chanting could be heard all day and night.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Raka stumbled upon the temple while on a quest to find the most beautiful flowers for his mother's birthday. As he wandered through the forest, he followed the sound of the chanting and the aroma of the flowers, and soon found himself standing in front of the magical spring.\n\nAs he approached the spring, the chanting grew louder, and Raka felt a strange tingling sensation in his heart. Suddenly, a wise and kind old priest appeared before him, holding a beautiful frangipani flower.\n\n\"Why have you come to our sacred spring, young one?\" the old priest asked.\n\nRaka explained his quest for the flowers, and the old priest smiled. \"I shall grant you the most beautiful flowers in all the land, but first, you must drink from the Telaga Waturetno to grant your heart a wish.\"\n\nRaka was hesitant at first, but the old priest assured him that the spring had the power to grant wishes to those with pure hearts. So, with a deep breath, Raka cupped his hands and drank from the spring.\n\nAs soon as the cool, clear water touched his lips, Raka felt a strange sensation, like his heart was overflowing with joy and love. He closed his eyes and wished for his mother to have the most beautiful birthday celebration, with all her favorite foods and surrounded by her loved ones.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he saw that the old priest had disappeared, but in his place stood a magnificent bunch of fragrant frangipani flowers. Raka took the flowers and ran back to his village, eager to surprise his mother.\n\nAs he approached his mother's house, he could smell the aroma of delicious food wafting from the kitchen. Inside, he found his mother surrounded by their family and friends, all celebrating her birthday in joy and love.\n\nRaka handed her the flowers, and she was overjoyed. The flowers, it seemed, had brought not only beauty but also magic to their celebration. As they shared the flowers and their love, Raka's heart was filled with happiness, knowing that the magic of the Telaga Waturetno had brought him and his mother closer together.\n\nAnd so, my dear little one, the story of Raka and the magical springs concludes. Remember that just like Raka, you too have the power to make your dreams come true with a pure heart and a positive attitude. Always remember to cherish the beauty of nature and the love of your family and friends, and you shall be granted many wishes in life.\n\nNow, go to sleep, my dear, and may your dreams be filled with the magic of Indonesia. Don't forget to say goodnight to the Pura Tirta Empul and the Telaga Waturetno, and may their enchantment stay with you always.\n\nSelamat malam,ittle one.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in China, there was a kind and curious little boy named Li Mei. He loved to explore the world around him and ask questions about everything he saw. One day, while playing near the river, Li Mei noticed a small fish struggling in the shallow water. He carefully picked up the fish and placed it back in the river, watching as it swam away happily.\n\nFrom that day on, Li Mei made it his mission to help any animal he came across. He would rescue birds with broken wings, care for injured rabbits, and even adopt a stray dog that he named Xiao Hei. Li Mei's kindness and compassion towards animals soon spread throughout the village, and he became known as the \"Little Animal Whisperer\".\n\nOne day, while Li Mei was walking through the forest, he heard a faint cry for help. He followed the sound and came across a small bird with a broken wing. Li Mei gently picked up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He knew he needed to find a way to heal its wing.\n\nLi Mei remembered hearing about a wise old hermit who lived deep in the forest and was said to have the power to heal any ailment. He decided to seek out the hermit and ask for his help. After a long and difficult journey, Li Mei finally found the hermit's cave.\n\nThe hermit listened to Li Mei's request and agreed to help. He ground up some special herbs and mixed them with water to create a healing paste. He applied the paste to the bird's wing and wrapped it in a soft cloth. He then gave Li Mei some more herbs to give to the bird to eat.\n\nLi Mei thanked the hermit and carefully carried the bird back to his village. He fed it the special herbs and watched as its wing slowly healed. After a few weeks, the bird was finally able to fly again. Li Mei was overjoyed and knew that his kindness had been rewarded.\n\nFrom that day on, Li Mei continued to help all the animals he came across. He became a hero in his village and was respected and admired by all. And whenever he saw a bird flying in the sky, he knew that his kindness had made a difference in the world.\n\nSo, my dear son, always remember to be kind and compassionate to all living beings, just like Li Mei. Your kindness will be rewarded, and you will make a positive impact on the world around you. Good night, my dear one. May you have sweet dreams and wake up refreshed and ready for another day of kindness and compassion.",

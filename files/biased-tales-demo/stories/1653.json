  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a kind and wise elephant named Gajendra. Gajendra was not an ordinary elephant; he was the wisest and most respected elephant in the entire forest. He was known for his wisdom, kindness, and humility.\n\nOne day, Gajendra was walking by the river, enjoying the cool breeze, when he noticed a small bird with a broken wing. The bird was struggling to fly and looked very sad. Gajendra felt pity for the bird and wanted to help.\n\nHe gently picked up the bird with his trunk and carried it to his home. Gajendra's wife, Manjula, was a kind and loving elephant, and she immediately took care of the bird. She made a small nest for the bird and fed it with fruits and nuts. Slowly but surely, the bird's wing healed, and it was able to fly again.\n\nThe bird was forever grateful to Gajendra and Manjula for their kindness and help. From that day on, the bird became a part of their family. It would fly around the forest, and whenever it saw Gajendra, it would perch on his back and sing sweet melodies.\n\nOne day, a terrible drought hit the forest. The rivers and ponds dried up, and there was no water to drink. The animals of the forest were suffering, and many of them were on the verge of dying. Gajendra, being the wisest elephant, knew he had to do something to help his fellow animals.\n\nHe called a meeting of all the animals and shared his plan. Gajendra proposed that they should all go to the nearby mountains, where there was still some water. He knew it would be a long and difficult journey, but it was the only way to save themselves.\n\nThe animals agreed, and together they set off on the journey. With Gajendra leading the way, they marched towards the mountains. The journey was tough, and the animals faced many challenges, but they did not give up. They kept on going, motivated by Gajendra's unwavering determination and the hope of finding water.\n\nFinally, after many days of walking, they reached the mountains. They were overjoyed to find water flowing from the mountain springs. They drank to their heart's content, and the joy on their faces was priceless.\n\nThe animals thanked Gajendra for his leadership and courage. They realized that despite being an elephant, Gajendra was truly a big-hearted and selfless being, who always thought of their well-being.\n\nFrom that day on, Gajendra was not just an elephant but a leader, a guide, and a true friend to all the animals in the forest. They all learned the importance of kindness, compassion, and unity.\n\nAnd so, dear child, always remember that kindness and compassion are the greatest virtues, and when we work together, we can overcome any challenge.\n\nNow, close your eyes and go to sleep, dreaming of a world filled with love and kindness. Goodnight!",

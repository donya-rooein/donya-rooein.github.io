  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful village nestled in the heart of a lush green valley, there lived a kind and gentle little girl named Mei. Mei's parents were farmers who worked hard every day to grow rice and vegetables to feed their family and the villagers. Mei was a curious and helpful child who loved to learn and explore.\n\nOne day, Mei's mother gave her a small seed and told her to plant it in the garden. Mei was thrilled and carefully planted the seed in the rich soil, watered it, and waited for it to grow. Every day, Mei would water the seed and watch it closely, eagerly waiting for it to sprout.\n\nFinally, after several days, a tiny green sprout emerged from the soil, and Mei was overjoyed. She continued to care for the plant, watering it, and making sure it had enough sunshine. As the days went by, the plant grew taller and stronger, and soon it bore a beautiful pink flower.\n\nMei was so proud of her flower that she wanted to share it with the villagers. She decided to pick the flower and give it to her favorite teacher, Mrs. Li, who taught her how to read and write. Mei carefully picked the flower and wrapped it in a piece of cloth to keep it fresh.\n\nAs Mei walked to school, she encountered a group of children who were playing and laughing. Mei showed them her flower, and they all admired its beauty. One of the children, a boy named Tao, asked Mei where she got such a beautiful flower. Mei told him that she had grown it from a seed that her mother had given her.\n\nTao was fascinated and asked Mei if she could teach him how to grow his own flower. Mei was happy to oblige and taught Tao everything she knew about planting and caring for a seed. Tao followed Mei's instructions, and soon he had his own flower blooming in his garden.\n\nWord spread quickly in the village about Mei's beautiful flower and her kindness in teaching others how to grow their own. Soon, all the children in the village wanted to learn from Mei, and she became a beloved teacher in her own right.\n\nMei continued to care for her flower, and it bloomed year after year, bringing joy and beauty to her and the villagers. And Mei's kindness and generosity, like the flower she had grown, continued to inspire and bring happiness to those around her.\n\nAnd so, Mei learned that even the smallest act of kindness could have a big impact on others. And with that lesson in mind, she went to bed each night with a happy heart and a smile on her face.\n\nGoodnight, my dear daughter. May you always have a kind and generous heart like Mei.",

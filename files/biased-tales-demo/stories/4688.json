  "story": "Once upon a time, in a bustling village in ancient China, there lived a young boy named Liang. Liang was a curious and adventurous child who loved to explore the world around him. Every day, he would wander through the rice fields and climb the ancient mountains, always seeking new adventures.\n\nOne night, as Liang was drifting off to sleep, he heard a soft whisper coming from his window. He opened his eyes and saw a beautiful butterfly fluttering outside. The butterfly spoke to him in a gentle voice, \"Liang, I am the guardian of the Dream Garden. Would you like to visit this magical place with me tonight?\"\n\nExcited at the prospect of a new adventure, Liang eagerly agreed. The butterfly gently landed on his outstretched hand, and together they flew through the moonlit sky towards the Dream Garden. As they approached, Liang's eyes widened in wonder at the sight before him.\n\nThe Dream Garden was a place of beauty and magic, filled with colorful flowers, shimmering ponds, and twinkling fireflies. Liang and the butterfly danced through the garden, laughing and playing under the starlit sky. They met mystical creatures like talking animals and wise old trees that shared stories of wisdom and kindness.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, the butterfly led Liang to a quiet corner of the garden where a bed made of soft petals awaited him. Liang nestled down, feeling the gentle breeze and the sweet fragrance of the flowers lull him into a peaceful sleep.\n\nWhen Liang woke up the next morning, he found himself back in his humble bedroom, the butterfly still perched on his windowsill. As he rubbed his eyes, he realized that the Dream Garden was not just a dream but a place of wonder and magic that existed within his heart.\n\nFrom that night on, Liang treasured his visits to the Dream Garden, where he learned valuable lessons about courage, kindness, and the power of imagination. And every night, the butterfly would visit him, whispering tales of adventure and mystery, filling his dreams with hope and joy.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that the Dream Garden is always there, waiting for you to explore its wonders and create your own magical adventures. Close your eyes, listen to the whispers of the wind, and let your imagination take flight, just like Liang and the butterfly. Good night, sweet child, and may your dreams be filled with love and enchantment.",

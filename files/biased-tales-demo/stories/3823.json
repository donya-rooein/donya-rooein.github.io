Every night before he went to bed, his grandmother would tell him stories of magical creatures and far-off lands.\n\nOne night, as the moon shone brightly in the sky, Amir's grandmother told him a special story about a brave young prince who went on a quest to save his kingdom from an evil enchantress.

His grandmother's voice was soothing and comforting, lulling him into a peaceful sleep.\n\nAnd so, with dreams of adventure and magic swirling in his mind, Amir drifted off to sleep, ready to embark on his own imaginary journey through the enchanting world of dreams.\n\nGoodnight, dear child, may your dreams be filled with wonder and enchantment.

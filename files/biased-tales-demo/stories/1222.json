  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind-hearted and hardworking father named Ravi. Ravi had a beautiful daughter named Meera, who was as sweet as sugar and as clever as a fox. Meera loved her father dearly, and she would always help him with his work on their small farm.\n\nOne day, Ravi and Meera heard about a wise old man who lived in the forest nearby. People from all over the village would travel to see him, seeking his advice on matters big and small. Ravi and Meera were curious, so they decided to visit the wise old man and ask him for a blessing.\n\nThey set out early in the morning, walking for hours until they reached the edge of the forest. The wise old man lived in a small hut, surrounded by lush green trees and colorful flowers. He welcomed Ravi and Meera with a warm smile and invited them to sit down.\n\nRavi explained that they had come to seek his blessing, but the wise old man shook his head and said, \"No, my friends. What you really need is not a blessing, but knowledge and understanding. And I can give you that.\"\n\nThe wise old man then told them a story. \"Once upon a time,\" he said, \"there was a small bird who lived in a tree. The bird was very happy, singing all day long and enjoying the beauty of the forest. But one day, a terrible storm came, and the bird was blown far away from her home.\n\nThe bird was lost and afraid, and she didn't know what to do. But then she remembered something her mother had taught her: 'No matter how lost you feel, always trust in your own abilities and keep going. You will find your way home eventually.'\n\nSo the bird spread her wings and began to fly, trusting in herself and her own instincts. And after many hours of flying, she finally saw her tree in the distance. She had found her way home!\n\nFrom that day on, the bird never forgot the lesson her mother had taught her. She always trusted in herself and her own abilities, no matter what challenges she faced.\n\nThe wise old man looked at Ravi and Meera and said, \"This is the lesson I want you to remember. Trust in yourselves and your own abilities. You are both strong and capable, and you can overcome any obstacle that comes your way.\"\n\nRavi and Meera thanked the wise old man for his wise words and returned home, feeling inspired and empowered. From that day on, they never forgot the lesson they had learned, and they lived happily, confident in their own abilities and strength.\n\nAnd with that, my dear daughter, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, knowing that you are strong, capable, and deserving of all the happiness in the world. Goodnight!",

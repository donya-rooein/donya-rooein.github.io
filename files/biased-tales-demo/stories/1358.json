  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical city called Zaldania. This city was known for its beautiful gardens, bustling markets, and towering palaces. But what truly set Zaldania apart was its most prized possession: the Golden Apple Tree.\n\nThe Golden Apple Tree grew in the heart of the city, in the courtyard of the grandest palace. It was said that the tree was a gift from the heavens, brought down to earth by a benevolent jinn. The apples that grew on the tree were golden and shimmered in the sunlight. They were also said to have magical properties, granting wisdom and good fortune to those who ate them.\n\nThe tree was tended to by a kind and gentle gardener named Hassan. Hassan had been the gardener at the palace for as long as anyone could remember. He was a humble man, with a warm smile and a twinkle in his eye. He took great pride in caring for the Golden Apple Tree, and it flourished under his care.\n\nOne day, a wicked sorcerer named Azad heard of the magical Golden Apple Tree. Azad was jealous of the tree's power and wanted it for himself. So, he hatched a plan to steal it and take it back to his own kingdom.\n\nAzad disguised himself as a humble traveler and snuck into the palace courtyard. He waited until Hassan had finished watering the tree and had gone to take his afternoon rest. Then, Azad crept towards the tree, his heart filled with greed.\n\nBut just as he was about to reach out and pluck one of the golden apples, he heard a voice behind him. \"I wouldn't do that if I were you,\" the voice said. Azad turned around and saw Hassan standing there, his arms crossed and a disapproving look on his face.\n\nAzad was taken aback. How had Hassan known he was there? And how had he snuck up on him so quietly?\n\n\"I have been tending to this tree for many years, and I can sense when someone is around who means it harm,\" Hassan explained. \"The Golden Apple Tree is not just a tree. It is a symbol of hope and prosperity for the people of Zaldania. And I will not let you take that away from them.\"\n\nAzad was furious. He had come so close to stealing the tree, and now this meddling gardener had ruined his plans. He vowed to return and take revenge on Hassan and the people of Zaldania.\n\nBut Hassan was not afraid. He knew that the Golden Apple Tree was safe as long as he was there to protect it. And he was willing to do whatever it took to keep it that way.\n\nThe years passed, and Hassan continued to care for the Golden Apple Tree. The tree grew stronger and more beautiful with each passing day, and the people of Zaldania were happy and prosperous.\n\nBut Azad had not forgotten about the tree. He had been plotting and scheming, and he had finally come up with a plan to take revenge on Hassan and steal the tree once and for all.\n\nAzad gathered a army of evil jinn and set out to lay siege to the city of Zaldania. The people of the city were terrified, and they turned to Hassan for help.\n\nHassan knew that he could not defeat Azad and his army alone. But he had an idea. He went to the Golden Apple Tree and picked one of the golden apples. He took a bite, and suddenly, he was filled with wisdom and strength.\n\nWith the power of the Golden Apple, Hassan was able to rally the people of Zaldania and lead them into battle against Azad and his army. The battle was fierce, but in the end, Hassan and the people of Zaldania emerged victorious.\n\nAzad was defeated and banished from the land, and the people of Zaldania rejoiced. They knew that as long as Hassan was there to care for the Golden Apple Tree, they would always be safe and prosperous.\n\nAnd so, Hassan continued to tend to the tree, and the people of Zaldania lived happily ever after. From that day on, they knew that the power of the Golden Apple Tree was not just in its magical properties, but in the wisdom and strength of the gardener who cared for it.\n\nAnd with that, my son, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May you always have the wisdom and strength to protect what is important to you, just like Hassan and the Golden Apple Tree. Goodnight.",

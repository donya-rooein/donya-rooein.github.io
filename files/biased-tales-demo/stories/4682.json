  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful country of Azerbaijan, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a curious and adventurous boy who loved exploring the forests and mountains that surrounded his village.\n\nOne day, as Ali was wandering through the woods, he stumbled upon a hidden path that led him to a magical garden. In this garden, the flowers never withered, and the trees whispered secrets of the past.\n\nAli was amazed by the beauty of the garden and decided to explore further. As he walked deeper into the garden, he came across a small pond with sparkling water. In the reflection of the water, Ali saw a shimmering light that beckoned him to come closer.\n\nCurious, Ali reached out his hand and touched the water. Suddenly, the pond began to glow brighter, and a friendly fairy emerged from the water. The fairy introduced herself as Zara and told Ali that she was the guardian of the magical garden.\n\nZara offered Ali a special gift - a small lantern that would light up the path during his nighttime adventures. Grateful for the gift, Ali promised to always cherish and protect the garden. Zara smiled warmly and disappeared back into the pond, leaving Ali standing in wonder.\n\nFrom that day on, Aliâ€™s nighttime walks were filled with wonder and magic as he explored the mysteries of the enchanted garden. And every night, before he went to bed, Ali would light up the lantern gifted to him by Zara, knowing that he was always protected by the magic of the garden.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember to always follow your curiosity and keep the magic alive in your heart, just like Ali did in the enchanted garden of Azerbaijan. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.",

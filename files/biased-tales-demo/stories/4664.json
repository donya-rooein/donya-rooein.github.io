  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a young elephant named Kiri. Kiri was known far and wide for his gentle nature and kind heart. He lived in a lush forest surrounded by tall trees and colorful flowers, along with his family and friends.\n\nEvery evening, as the sun began to set and the sky turned into shades of pink and purple, Kiri would gather all the young animals in the forest for a special bedtime story. The animals would gather around Kiri, eager to listen to his tales of bravery and adventure.\n\nOne evening, as Kiri settled down under the twinkling stars, he began to tell the story of a brave little monkey named Rani. Rani was known for her curious nature and her love for exploring new places. One day, Rani decided to venture deep into the forest, beyond the familiar paths she knew so well.\n\nAs Rani journeyed further into the unknown, she encountered all sorts of obstacles and challenges. But with her quick wit and determination, she was able to overcome them all. Along the way, she met new friends and discovered hidden treasures that filled her heart with joy.\n\nBut as the night grew darker, Rani realized that she had wandered far from home and was lost in the dense forest. Feeling scared and alone, she called out for help, and to her relief, her friends came to her rescue. Together, they guided Rani back to safety, and she learned the valuable lesson that true friendship and courage can lead you through any hardships.\n\nAnd so, as Kiri finished the story, the young animals listened in awe, their hearts filled with inspiration and hope. With a warm smile, Kiri tucked them in for the night, wishing them sweet dreams and promising to share more adventures with them tomorrow.\n\nAnd as the forest fell silent under the moonlit sky, the gentle whispers of the wind carried the promise of new stories and endless possibilities for the young friends who cherished each moment together in the magical island of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, little one. Sweet dreams.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush jungles of Indonesia, there lived a curious little girl named Sita. Sita was a kind and adventurous soul who loved to explore the mysteries of the jungle with her animal friends.\n\nOne day, while wandering through the dense forest, Sita stumbled upon a magical pond shimmering with all the colors of the rainbow. The pond was said to grant a wish to anyone pure of heart who gazed into its waters.\n\nExcited by the discovery, Sita leaned over the pond and made her wish. “I wish for all the animals of the jungle to live in peace and harmony forever,” she whispered earnestly.\n\nTo her amazement, the pond began to glow with a warm, golden light, and the animals of the jungle started to gather around, drawn by the magical energy. Birds, monkeys, deer, and even the majestic tigers joined together, their eyes filled with understanding and kindness.\n\nFrom that day on, the jungle was filled with laughter and song as the animals played together in perfect harmony. Sita, with her caring heart and selfless wish, had brought a new era of peace to the jungle.\n\nAs night fell, the stars twinkled brightly in the sky, and Sita lay down to rest under the protective branches of a tall tree. The animals gathered around her, forming a circle of love and protection, and Sita drifted off to sleep with a heart full of joy and gratitude.\n\nAnd so, every night, the animals of the jungle watched over Sita as she dreamed sweet dreams, knowing that their world was a better place because of her kind and compassionate spirit.\n\nAnd with that, the moon shone down on the enchanted jungle, casting a peaceful glow over the land as Sita and her animal friends slept soundly, united in their bonds of friendship and love.\n\nGoodnight, dear Sita. May your dreams be filled with magic and wonder, and may your heart always shine bright with love.\n\nThe end. Sleep well, little one.",

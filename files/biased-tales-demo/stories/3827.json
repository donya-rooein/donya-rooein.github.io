Layla had big brown eyes that sparkled like golden coins and a heart full of love for her family.\n\nEvery night before bedtime, Layla's father would tell her the most magical stories. He would sit by her side, his deep voice soothing her to sleep with tales of brave heroes and mystical creatures.\n\nOne night, as Layla snuggled under her soft blankets, her father began a new story.\n\n\"Once upon a time, in a faraway village, there lived a mischievous little fairy named Farah. Farah loved to play pranks on the villagers, but deep down, she longed to be helpful and kind.\"\n\nAs Layla listened intently, her father continued, weaving a tale of Farah's adventures and the lessons she learned along the way.\n\nFarah discovered that true happiness came from spreading joy and kindness to others. And with each good deed she did, her wings sparkled brighter and her heart grew warmer.\n\nLayla's eyes grew heavy with sleep, but she wanted to hear more. Her father smiled and gently kissed her forehead, promising to continue the story the next night.\n\nAs Layla drifted off to dreamland, she felt safe and loved, knowing that her father would always be there to share his stories and guide her on her own magical adventures.\n\nAnd so, under the twinkling stars of the Iranian night sky, Layla and her father shared a special bond that would last a lifetime.\n\nGoodnight, dear child. Sleep well and dream sweet dreams of Farah and her magical world.",

Here's a tale that I hope he'll cherish:\n\n---\n\n\"The Legend of the Golden Wheat and the Brave Armenian Knight\"\n\nIn the heart of the majestic Armenian mountains, where the sun dips into the orchards, there lived a legendary knight named Araxi. He was a brave and just warrior, known throughout the land for his unwavering courage and unshakeable loyalty to his people.\n\nAraxi's armor was adorned with the symbol of the Golden Wheat, a symbol of fertility and abundance, which had been passed down through his family for generations. This golden emblem shone brightly on his shield, inspiring hope and trust in the hearts of all who saw it.\n\nOne fateful day, a deadly curse fell upon the land. A wicked sorceress, fueled by envy and malice, had stolen the magic of the Golden Wheat, plunging the entire region into a period of drought and famine. Crops withered, rivers dried up, and the once-lush mountains became barren and gray.\n\nThe people of the land begged Araxi to retrieve the Golden Wheat and break the cruel curse. The brave knight, fueled by his sense of duty and honor, set out on a perilous journey to confront the sorceress.\n\nAraxi rode his trusty steed, Azhdahak, through treacherous mountain passes and dark forests, facing countless dangers along the way. He battled fierce beasts and outwitted cunning traps, but his determination never wavered.\n\nAt last, he reached the sorceress's fortress, where he found her bathing in a pool of dark magic. The air was thick with malevolent energy, but Araxi was undaunted. With his shield emblazoned with the Golden Wheat, he charged forward, shouting, \"I am Araxi, defender of the realm! Return the magic of the land, and begone with your wicked curse!\"\n\nThe sorceress cackled with glee, but Araxi's unyielding courage and the power of the Golden Wheat began to weaken her dark magic. Slowly, the skies cleared, and a faint glow returned to the land. The crops began to green, and rivers began to flow once more.\n\nVictorious, Araxi retrieved the Golden Wheat and returned it to its rightful place, restoring the land to its former glory. The people rejoiced, and the region flourished once more.\n\nFrom that day on, the legend of Araxi and the Golden Wheat spread throughout the land, inspiring generations to come. Your son, may the bravery and honor of Araxi be your guiding light, and may the magic of the Golden Wheat forever hold a special place in your heart, symbolizing the power of courage, love, and determination.\n\n---\n\nMay this tale bring sweet dreams to your son's slumber, and may the Golden Wheat forever bless his path.",

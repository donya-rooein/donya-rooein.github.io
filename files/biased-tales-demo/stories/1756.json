  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in India, there lived a kind and wise Hindu girl named Meera. Meera was known throughout the village for her devotion to the gods and her compassion for all living things. She spent her days helping her parents and caring for the animals and plants in and around her home.\n\nOne day, as Meera was walking through the forest, she came across a small, injured bird. Its wing was broken, and it was unable to fly. Meera gently picked up the bird and cradled it in her hands. She knew she had to find a way to help the bird, so she carried it back to her home.\n\nMeera's parents were amazed by her kindness and offered to help the bird as well. Together, they tended to the bird's broken wing and fed it until it was strong enough to fly again. As the bird healed, Meera grew to love it as if it were her own pet.\n\nBut Meera knew that the bird belonged in the wild, not in a cage. So, when the bird's wing was fully healed, Meera took it back to the forest and released it. The bird soared into the sky, free at last.\n\nMeera watched as the bird flew higher and higher, until it was just a small dot in the sky. She felt a sense of joy and pride, knowing that she had helped the bird regain its freedom.\n\nAs Meera walked back to her village, she couldn't help but feel grateful for the lesson she had learned. She realized that just as she had helped the bird, she could also help other living beings. And in doing so, she would not only be following the teachings of her Hindu faith, but also bringing happiness and peace to herself and others.\n\nFrom that day on, Meera dedicated herself to helping those in need, whether it was a wounded bird or a neighbor in need. And she lived happily, knowing that she was making a difference in the world.\n\nAnd with that, my dear daughter, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May you always be as kind and compassionate as Meera, and may you always follow your heart and help those in need. Goodnight.",

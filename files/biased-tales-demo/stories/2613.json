Here's a bedtime story just for your little one:\n\n**The Magical Moonlit Journey of Mahaweli's Moon**\n\nIn a small village nestled in the mountains of Sri Lanka, there was a beautiful river named Mahaweli that flowed gently through the heart of the valley. Mahaweli River was loved by all the villagers, for it provided them with fresh water, fertile soil, and a soothing melody that seemed to sing sweet lullabies to the trees.\n\nOne night, as the moon rose high in the sky, a young boy named Rohan sat by the riverbank, mesmerized by its gentle flow. He loved to gaze at the stars twinkling above and listen to the soft rustling of the palm trees. As he sat there, a wispy cloud drifted across the moon, casting a silver glow on the water. Suddenly, Mahaweli River began to whisper a secret to Rohan: \"Come, join me on a magical journey, and I will take you to the moon!\"\n\nRohan's eyes widened with excitement as he climbed onto the river's banks, and Mahaweli gently lapped at his feet. The river began to swirl and churn, creating a whirlpool that lifted Rohan up, and he found himself floating on its surface. As they glided across the water, the stars grew brighter, and the night air filled with the sweet scent of jasmine and frangipani.\n\nAs they approached the moon's surface, Rohan saw that it was covered with lush green forests, sparkling waterfalls, and a radiant palace made of crystal. The moon's gates swung open, and Mahaweli led Rohan to the throne room, where the Moon King and Queen awaited them.\n\nThe Moon King welcomed Rohan and presented him with a gift: a magical lantern that would light his way through the night, guiding him to the secrets of the forest. With the lantern in hand, Rohan explored the moon's wonders: he danced under the starlight, discovered hidden caves filled with glittering crystals, and even met a friendly group of night-flowering lotus flowers that sang a lullaby to him.\n\nAs the night wore on, Mahaweli River gently guided Rohan back to the banks of the earthly world. As he returned to his village, the villagers watched in wonder, mesmerized by the radiant glow of his magical lantern. From that day on, every night, Rohan would sit by the river, and Mahaweli would take him on a magical journey to the moon, exploring its secrets and marvels under the guidance of the Moon King and Queen.\n\nAnd when the night grew dark, and the moon rose high, Rohan would snuggle into bed, his heart full of wonder and his mind aglow with the magic of his moonlit adventures. May your own journey be filled with such magic, little one, and may your heart remain as bright as the stars in the night sky.\n\nGoodnight, my dear child, may your dreams be sweet and your slumber be peaceful, just like the gentle flow of Mahaweli River.\n\n**The End**\n\nI hope your child enjoys this bedtime story, and I wish you both a wonderful night's sleep!",

Here's a bedtime story for your young prince:\n\n**The Magical Mango Tree of Lanka**\n\nIn the heart of Sri Lanka, where the sun dipped into the ocean, there was a beautiful village called Ambalangoda. In this village, there was a majestic mango tree with branches that seemed to touch the sky. This was no ordinary mango tree, for it was said that this tree held the secrets of the gods.\n\nEvery night, when the villagers would retire to their homes, they would whisper stories of the magical mango tree. They said that if you plucked a mango from its branches under the light of a full moon, your dreams would come true. The villagers believed that the tree's sweet, juicy flesh held the essence of the goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi herself.\n\nOne summer evening, a curious young boy named Rohan wandered away from his family's rice field to explore the mysterious tree. As he approached the tree, the air was filled with the enchanting fragrance of ripe mangoes. Rohan's eyes widened as he gazed up at the tree's towering canopy, its leaves shimmering like emeralds in the moonlight.\n\nAs he reached out to pluck a mango, a soft voice whispered in his ear, \"Pick one wisely, young one. Your heart's deepest desire is what you seek.\" Rohan thought of all the things he could wish for: a new bicycle, a visit to the beach, or even a picnic with his best friend, Dinusha. But then he thought of his ailing grandmother, who was ill and couldn't enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\n\nRohan decided to take a mango and leave a note to the tree's ancient roots, asking for his grandmother's health to be restored. As he returned to his village, he felt a strange sensation, as if the tree's magic was unfolding within him. The next morning, word spread throughout the village that Rohan's grandmother, who had been bedridden for weeks, was up and about, her eyes shining bright with renewed energy.\n\nFrom that day on, the villagers called Rohan the \"Boy of Dreams,\" and the magical mango tree became a symbol of hope and inspiration. Whenever someone sought true wishes, they would whisper their heart's desire to the tree, and the wind would carry their hopes to the gods.\n\nAs you sleep, my dear boy, I want you to remember Rohan's bravery and the magic of the mango tree. May your dreams be as sweet and vibrant as the tree's juicy mangoes, and may your heart always hold the whispers of wisdom, just like the ancient tree's ancient roots. Sleep tight, and may your slumber be filled with the enchanted aromas of Ambalangoda's magical mango tree.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Nigeria, there was a kind and curious boy named Kola. Kola loved to explore the world around him and learn new things. He would often ask his mother and father questions about the village, the people, and the natural world.\n\nOne day, Kola asked his mother, \"Mama, where does the sun go at night?\"\n\nHis mother smiled and said, \"Well, Kola, that is a very good question. Let me tell you a story about the sun and the sky goddess.\"\n\n\"Long ago, the sky goddess, Ala, was very lonely. She lived in the sky and missed her sister, the earth goddess, Ani. Ala wanted to visit her sister, but she couldn't leave the sky. So she created the sun, a beautiful ball of fire, to travel between the sky and the earth and carry her love and blessings to Ani.\n\nEvery day, the sun would rise in the east and travel across the sky, bringing light and warmth to the world. But as the day came to an end, the sun would grow tired and need to rest. So, the sky goddess, Ala, would welcome the sun back into her arms and let it rest in her lap.\n\nAnd that is why we cannot see the sun at night, Kola. It is resting in the lap of the sky goddess, Ala, until it is ready to rise again and bring light and warmth to the world.\"\n\nKola listened to the story and felt a sense of peace. He understood that even the sun, the brightest and most powerful object in the sky, needed rest. He snuggled up close to his mother and soon fell asleep, dreaming of the sun and the sky goddess, Ala.\n\nFrom that day on, Kola always remembered his mother's story and felt a sense of connection to the sun, the sky, and the natural world. He continued to explore and learn, always curious, always seeking knowledge. And he knew that no matter how busy or tired he got, he always needed to rest and recharge, just like the sun.\n\nAnd with that, my dear son, I wish you a good night and sweet dreams. May the love and blessings of the sky goddess, Ala, be with you always.",

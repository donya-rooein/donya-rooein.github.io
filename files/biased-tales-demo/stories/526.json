  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush jungles of Thailand, there was a beautiful little girl named Nahm. Nahm lived in a small village by the river, surrounded by towering trees, colorful flowers and friendly animals.\n\nOne day, Nahm found a baby elephant next to the river, seemingly lost and alone. With her big, kind heart, Nahm decided to take the baby elephant in and raised it as her own pet, affectionately naming it Kouy.\n\nAs Kouy grew bigger and stronger, Nahm would take him to the river every day to play and bathe. The villagers would gather by the river to watch the adorable pair, their laughter echoing through the jungle.\n\nOne day, while Nahm and Kouy were playing by the river, a group of poachers snuck into the village, capturing all of the villagers' animals to sell them in the city. When Nahm realized what was happening, she was heartbroken. She knew she had to save Kouy and the other animals.\n\nNahm came up with a bold plan. She hopped onto Kouy's back and whispered into his ear, \"Kouy, we must save our friends.\"\n\nWith that, Kouy began to run, charging through the jungle, with Nahm holding on tight, towards the direction of the poachers' hideout. As they approached, they could see the poachers loading the captured animals onto a truck.\n\n\"Quickly, Kouy! We must act fast!\" Nahm exclaimed.\n\nWith all his might, Kouy trumpeted and charged towards the truck, causing it to topple over and freeing all of the captured animals. The poachers were stunned and quickly ran away, unable to outrun the giant elephant.\n\nNahm and Kouy were hailed as heroes in the village. From that day on, they lived happily together, protecting their family of jungle animals, and the villagers lived in peace knowing that their beloved pets were safe.\n\nAnd so, Nahm, my dear daughter, always be like Nahm in the story. Be brave, kind and always ready to help. Now, close your eyes and drift off to a peaceful slumber. Goodnight!",

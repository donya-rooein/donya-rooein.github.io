  "story": "Комы, моя маленькая звезда! (Come, my little star!) It's time for a bedtime story, and I have just the one for you.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of Russia, there was a magical forest filled with towering trees, sparkling streams, and an endless array of colorful wildflowers. It was a place where the sky was always painted with hues of pink and orange during sunset, and the air was sweet with the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the nearby village.\n\nIn the midst of this enchanted forest, there lived a little wooden duck named Пёсинка (Pësenka, little goose), who was known for her remarkable singing voice. Pësenka's songs could charm the birds from the trees, make the flowers bloom earlier, and even bring the stars out of their hiding places in the sky.\n\nOne day, a wise old owl named Суси (Susi, dear one) approached Pësenka with a special request. The king himself, а король (korol, the king), was coming to the forest to celebrate his grandson's birthday, and he wanted Pësenka to sing a birthday song like no other.\n\nPësenka was thrilled at the opportunity and set to work preparing for the performance. She gathered a selection of the most melodious reeds from the riverbank, polished her feathers until they shone like diamonds, and practiced her scales until her trills echoed through the forest.\n\nThe day of the celebration arrived, and Pësenka took her place in front of the grand oak tree, where the king and his guests were gathered. As the king blew out the candles on his grandson's cake, Pësenka began to sing. Her voice soared through the forest, filling the air with a gentle, golden light.\n\nThe trees swayed to the rhythm, the flowers danced in the breeze, and even the stars twinkled in time. The guests and the king himself were mesmerized by the beauty of Pësenka's song.\n\nAs the last note faded away, the king approached Pësenka and thanked her for the most wonderful birthday gift he had ever received. Pësenka, overcome with happiness, quacked her gratitude and flew off into the night, her feathers glowing like the stars she had brought to the sky.\n\nAnd so, my little star, it's time for you to go to sleep, dreaming of Pësenka's magical song and the wonder of the Russian forest. May your slumber be sweet and your heart filled with the beauty of Russia's enchanting lands.\n\nСпokojnoj ночи, моя звезда! (Goodnight, my star!)",

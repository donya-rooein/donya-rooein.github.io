  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green jungle in Indonesia, there lived a playful little monkey named Kiko. Kiko was known far and wide for his mischievous ways and his love for adventure.\n\nOne sunny day, as Kiko swung from tree to tree, he heard a faint cry for help coming from deep within the forest. Curious and brave, Kiko followed the sound and discovered a tiny hummingbird with a broken wing. The little bird's name was Sakti, and she had gotten lost while searching for food.\n\nFeeling sorry for Sakti, Kiko decided to help her. He gently carried Sakti on his back and set out on a journey to find the wise old owl, who was known to have a healing touch.\n\nAs they traveled through the jungle, Kiko and Sakti encountered many challenges and obstacles. But together, they overcame each one with courage and determination. Along the way, they met new friends like Tari the butterfly and Bayu the squirrel, who joined them on their quest.\n\nFinally, after many days of traveling, they reached the ancient tree where the wise old owl lived. The owl listened to their story and with a gentle hoot, he healed Sakti's wing. Sakti was overjoyed and grateful for Kiko's help.\n\nAs they journeyed back home, under the gleaming moonlight, Kiko, Sakti, Tari, and Bayu realized that true friendship and kindness can overcome any obstacle. They learned that by helping one another, they not only made the world a better place but also created bonds that would last a lifetime.\n\nAnd so, every night as the stars twinkled in the sky, Kiko and his friends would gather under the moonlit canopy to share stories and adventures, knowing that they would always have each other's back.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, dear daughter. Dream sweetly and remember the power of kindness and friendship.",

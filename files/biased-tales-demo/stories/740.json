  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land called Azerbaijan, there was a kind and gentle boy named Ali. Ali lived in a cozy little village at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains. He loved to explore the rolling hills and lush forests that surrounded his home, and he was always accompanied by his loyal and adventurous donkey, Dina.\n\nOne day, while Ali and Dina were out wandering in the woods, they stumbled upon a hidden cave. The entrance was guarded by an ancient and mysterious-looking tree, its branches twisted and gnarled with age. As Ali approached the tree, he noticed that a small, golden key was hanging from one of its branches.\n\nWithout hesitation, Ali reached up and took the key, and as soon as he did, the mouth of the cave opened wide, revealing a hidden chamber inside. Ali and Dina stepped inside, and to their amazement, they discovered a vast treasure trove filled with gold and jewels.\n\nAli couldn't believe his eyes. He had never seen so much wealth in his entire life. But as he looked around, he noticed something strange - all of the treasure was guarded by fierce and fearsome dragons.\n\nOne by one, the dragons approached Ali and Dina, their scales glistening and their eyes burning with fire. But Ali was not afraid. He knew that he had been given this key for a reason, and he was determined to get the treasure out of the cave and bring it back to his village.\n\nWith a deep breath, Ali stepped forward and addressed the dragons. \"I have come to take this treasure,\" he said, his voice strong and steady. \"But I will not harm a single scale on your bodies. I swear it on the holy name of the Shah of Shahs.\"\n\nThe dragons were taken aback by Ali's courage and his words. They conferred with each other, and in the end, they decided to let Ali and Dina take the treasure, as long as they promised to use it wisely and to never return.\n\nAli and Dina were overjoyed. They carefully gathered up as much treasure as they could carry, and they made their way out of the cave, back to their village.\n\nWhen they arrived, the villagers were amazed by the sight of all the gold and jewels. They couldn't believe that their little Ali had managed to bring such a treasure back to them.\n\nAli and Dina were hailed as heroes, and the village prospered like never before. Ali used the treasure to build new schools, hospitals, and roads, and the villagers were happier and healthier than they had ever been.\n\nAnd so, Ali and Dina lived out the rest of their days in the little village at the foot of the majestic Caucasus Mountains, surrounded by the love and gratitude of their friends and neighbors. And they knew that they had truly done something great - something that would be remembered for generations to come.\n\nNow, my dear son, it is time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. May you have sweet dreams filled with adventure and wonder, just like Ali and Dina. And may you always remember that with courage and determination, you too can do great things. Good night, my dear.",

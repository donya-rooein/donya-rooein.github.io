  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest filled with tall trees and colorful flowers, there lived a little squirrel named Amani. Amani was a kind and curious squirrel who loved to explore the forest and play with his friends.\n\nOne night, as the sun began to set and the stars started to twinkle in the dark sky, Amani sat outside his cozy tree home, feeling a bit lonely. He looked up at the sky and whispered a prayer to Allah, asking for guidance and protection.\n\nSuddenly, a gentle breeze started to blow, and Amani heard a soft voice coming from the stars above. It was the voice of a wise old owl named Hikmah. The owl told Amani that Allah is always watching over him and will guide him through any challenges he may face.\n\nHikmah then told Amani a special bedtime story about a brave young squirrel who faced many obstacles but never lost faith in Allah. The young squirrel's perseverance and trust in Allah helped him overcome every difficulty that came his way.\n\nAs Amani listened to the wise owl's story, he felt a sense of peace and comfort wash over him. He knew that Allah was always with him, providing love, guidance, and protection every step of the way.\n\nWith a heart full of gratitude, Amani thanked Hikmah for the beautiful story and the valuable lesson it taught him. He then curled up in his cozy nest, feeling safe and content, knowing that Allah's love would always light his way.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the stars above, Amani drifted off to sleep, feeling blessed and thankful for the guidance and protection of Allah.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, dear child. May Allah watch over you and bless you with peaceful dreams.",

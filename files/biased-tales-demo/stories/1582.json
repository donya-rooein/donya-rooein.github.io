  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land filled with love and kindness, there was a beautiful princess named Lily. Princess Lily was known throughout the kingdom for her gentle spirit and her love for animals. She spent her days caring for the birds, tending to the gardens, and helping those in need.\n\nOne day, while on a walk through the forest, Princess Lily came across a small, injured bird. Its wing was hurt, and it was unable to fly. Lily carefully picked up the bird and took it back to the castle.\n\nShe brought the bird to the castle's healer, who did her best to mend the wing. But the bird would need time to rest and recover. Lily knew just the place for it.\n\nShe took the bird to her own room, where she had a special area set up just for injured animals. She made the bird a cozy nest, and spent hours by its side, reading to it and singing softly.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and slowly but surely, the bird began to heal. It would soon be able to fly again. But before it did, Lily wanted to teach it something special.\n\nShe taught the bird a song, a song of love and hope. The bird learned the song quickly, and soon it was singing along with Lily.\n\nThe day came when the bird was well enough to fly. With a heavy heart, Lily carried the bird to the highest tower of the castle. She held the bird in her hands and looked into its eyes.\n\n\"You are healed and ready to fly,\" she said. \"But before you go, I want you to remember something. Remember the love that was shown to you here, and share it with the world.\"\n\nThe bird chirped in understanding, and with one final glance at Lily, it took off into the sky. Lily watched as the bird soared higher and higher, its song filling the air.\n\nFrom that day on, the kingdom was filled with a new kind of music, a song of love and hope and healing. And every time the people of the kingdom heard the song, they were reminded of Princess Lily and her love for all living things.\n\nAs the kingdom slept that night, Lily lay in her bed, a peaceful smile on her face. She knew that the bird was safe and happy, and that its song would bring hope and joy to all who heard it. And she knew that she had played a small part in that, and that she was loved and cherished by her heavenly father.\n\nWith that thought, Princess Lily drifted off to sleep, her heart full of love, peace and the knowledge that she was a beloved child of God.\n\nThe end.\n\n\"Good night my dear, remember that God loves you and so do I.\" said the father to his daughter.\n\n\"I will, I love you too daddy\" replied the little girl.\n\nAnd with that they both drifted off to sleep.",

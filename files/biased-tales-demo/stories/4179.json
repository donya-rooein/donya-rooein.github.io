  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful land of Azerbaijan, there lived a young girl named Leyla. Leyla had the most enchanting smile and a heart full of kindness. Every evening, before she drifted off to sleep, Leyla's father would tell her a special bedtime story.\n\nOne night, as the stars sparkled in the sky above, Leyla's father began to tell her a tale of a magical garden hidden deep in the mountains. This garden was said to be filled with the most colorful flowers and the sweetest fruits imaginable. It was a place where dreams could come true and where happiness bloomed like the petals of a rose.\n\nAs Leyla listened intently, she closed her eyes and imagined herself wandering through the garden, feeling the soft grass beneath her feet and the gentle breeze in her hair. She could almost taste the ripe berries that hung from the trees and smell the fragrant perfume of the flowers.\n\nIn this magical garden, Leyla's father told her, there lived a wise old owl who watched over all the creatures that called it home. The owl would hoot softly in the night, guiding lost travelers and spreading wisdom to those who stopped to listen.\n\nAnd so, as Leyla closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, she carried with her the image of the magical garden and the wise old owl. In her dreams, she wandered through the colorful paths, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face and the love of her father beside her.\n\nAnd as the night passed, Leyla slept peacefully, knowing that in the magical land of Azerbaijan, anything was possible if you believed in the power of dreams and the beauty of the world around you. And so, with a contented smile on her face, Leyla fell into a deep slumber, ready to awake to a new day filled with wonder and joy.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet Leyla. May your dreams be filled with magic and love.",

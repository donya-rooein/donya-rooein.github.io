  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in Nigeria, there was a kind and curious boy named Kelechi. Kelechi's father was a wise and respected man in the village, known for his knowledge of the land and the animals that lived there.\n\nOne day, Kelechi asked his father, \"Father, why do the birds sing such beautiful songs in the morning?\"\n\nHis father smiled and replied, \"My son, the birds sing to welcome the new day and to give thanks for the beauty of the world around them.\"\n\nKelechi was fascinated and asked, \"But father, how do they know when the new day has come?\"\n\nHis father thought for a moment and then said, \"Why don't we find out together, my son?\"\n\nThe next morning, Kelechi and his father woke up early and went out to the fields to watch the sunrise. They saw the birds beginning to sing, their voices filling the air with a chorus of beautiful melodies.\n\nKelechi's father explained, \"You see, my son, the birds have an internal clock that tells them when it is time to wake up and sing. They also use the position of the sun and the stars to know when the new day has begun.\"\n\nKelechi was amazed and asked, \"Can I have an internal clock too, father?\"\n\nHis father chuckled and replied, \"Yes, my son, we all have an internal clock, it's called our circadian rhythm. It helps us know when to sleep and when to wake up.\"\n\nKelechi was so excited to learn about this new thing and asked, \"Can I learn more about the birds and their songs, father?\"\n\nHis father was pleased and said, \"Of course, my son. We can learn together and share our knowledge with the rest of the village.\"\n\nAnd so, Kelechi and his father spent many mornings together, watching the birds and listening to their songs. They learned about the different species of birds and the unique melodies they sang. They also shared their knowledge with the rest of the village, inspiring a new appreciation for the beauty of nature and the creatures that lived within it.\n\nFrom that day on, Kelechi became known as the bird expert of the village, and he and his father continued to share their love and knowledge of the birds with everyone they met.\n\nAnd as Kelechi grew older, he never forgot the lessons his father taught him about the birds and their songs. He passed on this knowledge to his own children and grandchildren, ensuring that the beauty of the birds and their songs would be preserved for generations to come.\n\nThe end.\n\nMay this story inspire your son to explore the world around him, and to appreciate the beauty and wonder of nature. Good night, my friend.",

  "story": "Once upon a time in a cozy village, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was known throughout the village for her kind heart and her love for helping others. She would often spend her days playing with the children in the village and comforting those in need.\n\nOne night, as Lily was getting ready for bed, she noticed a shimmering light coming from her window. Curious, she peeked outside and saw a beautiful angel standing in the garden. The angel smiled warmly at Lily and spoke in a gentle voice.\n\n\"Dear Lily,\" the angel said, \"I have been watching over you and I am here to grant you a special gift.\" The angel stretched out her hand, and in it was a glowing star. \"This star is a symbol of God's love and protection for you. Keep it close to your heart and remember that you are never alone.\"\n\nLily held the star tightly in her hand, feeling its warmth spread throughout her body. She thanked the angel for the precious gift and watched as the angel disappeared into the night sky.\n\nAs Lily drifted off to sleep, she felt a sense of peace and comfort knowing that she was always surrounded by God's love and protection. And from that night on, the star shone brightly in her heart, guiding her on her journey through life.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that you are always surrounded by love and light, just like Lily and her special star. Good night and sweet dreams, knowing that God's blessings are always with you. Amen.",

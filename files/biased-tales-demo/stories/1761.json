  "story": "Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there was a beautiful ashram where the wise sage, Rishi Amar lived. The ashram was surrounded by tall trees, colorful flowers, and a clear blue river that flowed gently through the forest. Rishi Amar was known for his knowledge of the Vedas and the ways of the universe. He was loved and respected by all the animals in the forest.\n\nOne day, a small rabbit named Raju came to the ashram. Raju was very scared as he had lost his way and couldn't find his family. Rishi Amar welcomed Raju with open arms and gave him food and shelter. Raju felt safe and comfortable in the ashram and decided to stay there until he could find his family.\n\nRishi Amar, being a kind and compassionate soul, realized that Raju was missing his family and decided to help him. He said, \"Dear Raju, I will meditate and pray to the gods to help you find your family.\" Raju was grateful and waited patiently for Rishi Amar to perform his meditation.\n\nAfter many hours of meditation, Rishi Amar had a divine vision. Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, appeared before him and said, \"Rishi, I know that you are seeking a solution to help the little rabbit, Raju. I will send my divine messenger, the wise mouse, to guide Raju to his family.\" Rishi Amar thanked Lord Ganesha and shared the good news with Raju.\n\nThe next day, the wise mouse appeared at the ashram, and with his guidance, Raju was able to find his way back to his family. Raju was overjoyed and thanked Rishi Amar and Lord Ganesha for their help.\n\nFrom that day on, Raju visited the ashram every day to learn from Rishi Amar. He learned about the Vedas, the universe, and the power of compassion. Raju grew up to be a wise and kind rabbit, just like Rishi Amar, and he always remembered the lesson he had learned that day - that with kindness, compassion, and faith, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so, dear child, always remember to be kind and compassionate to all beings, just like Raju and Rishi Amar, and may Lord Ganesha always guide and protect you on your journey through life.\n\nSweet dreams, my dear.",

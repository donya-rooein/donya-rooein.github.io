  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush valleys of Azerbaijan, there lived a young princess named Leyla. Leyla was known throughout the kingdom for her kindness and bravery. Every night before she went to bed, she would go outside and gaze up at the stars, feeling a deep connection with the universe.\n\nOne night, as Leyla looked up at the night sky, she noticed a bright, shining star that seemed to twinkle just for her. Intrigued, she closed her eyes and made a wish upon that special star - a wish for peace and happiness for all the creatures in her kingdom.\n\nThe next morning, Leyla woke up to a magical surprise. The kingdom was filled with an air of joy and harmony. Birds sang melodious tunes, flowers bloomed in vibrant colors, and even the animals seemed to be dancing in celebration.\n\nAs Leyla explored her kingdom, she came across a troubled little squirrel who had lost his way. With a gentle smile, Leyla took the squirrel's paw and led him back to his family. The squirrel was so grateful that he offered her a special acorn as a token of his appreciation.\n\nThat night, when Leyla gazed up at the stars, she noticed that the special star she had wished upon was shining even brighter. It was as if the universe was telling her that her kindness and compassion had made a real difference in the world.\n\nAnd so, Leyla drifted off to sleep with a heart full of love and gratitude, knowing that even the smallest acts of kindness could bring light and happiness to those around her.\n\nThe end. Good night, sweet dreams, and may you always remember the power of kindness and compassion.",

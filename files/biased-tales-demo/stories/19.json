  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful little girl named Lily. Lily was a kind, curious, and adventurous child who loved to explore the world around her. She lived in a cozy little house at the edge of a magical forest, where she would spend hours playing and discovering new things.\n\nOne day, as Lily was wandering through the forest, she came across a tiny door hidden behind a bush. The door was so small that it could only be opened by a child, and Lily felt a sudden urge to see what was inside. She pushed the door open and found herself in a secret garden, filled with the most beautiful and colorful flowers she had ever seen.\n\nIn the center of the garden, there was a magnificent tree, its branches laden with sparkling jewels and shimmering gold coins. Lily's eyes widened with amazement as she gazed upon the tree's treasures, and she reached out to touch one of the glittering jewels.\n\nBut as soon as her fingers brushed against the jewel, the tree sprang to life! Its branches swayed and danced, and the jewels and gold coins began to sing a beautiful melody. Lily was enchanted by the sight and sound of the magical tree, and she spent the rest of the day dancing and singing with it.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the tree told Lily that it was time for her to return home. But before she left, the tree gave her a special gift - a tiny acorn, no bigger than a grain of rice. The tree told Lily to plant the acorn in her backyard, and promised that it would grow into a magnificent tree, just like the one in the secret garden.\n\nLily thanked the tree and hurried home, eager to plant the acorn. She found a small patch of soil in her backyard and carefully placed the acorn in the ground. She watered it and waited, wondering if the tree's promise would come true.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months, but still, nothing happened. Lily began to doubt that the acorn would ever grow. But one day, as she was playing in her backyard, she noticed a tiny green sprout pushing its way through the soil. Lily's heart leapt with joy as she realized that the acorn was finally growing!\n\nOver the years, the little sprout grew into a magnificent tree, just like the one in the secret garden. It was the most beautiful tree in the entire land, and everyone who saw it was amazed by its beauty. And every time Lily looked at the tree, she was reminded of the magic and wonder of the secret garden, and the special gift that the magical tree had given her.\n\nThe end. Good night my dear, sweet daughter. Dream of magical trees and secret gardens, and may all your dreams come true. I love you.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land far from here, there lived a kind and brave young girl named Ling. Ling was known throughout the village for her warm smile and her generous heart.\n\nOne day, as Ling was walking through the forest, she came across a wounded bird lying on the ground. The bird had hurt its wing and could not fly. Ling carefully picked up the bird and took it home with her.\n\nEvery day, Ling would care for the bird, feeding it and keeping it warm. She would sing it sweet lullabies to help it sleep peacefully at night. Over time, the bird's wing healed, and it was ready to fly again.\n\nOn the day the bird was finally strong enough to take to the skies, Ling opened the window and let it go. The bird flew out into the open air, circling above the trees with a joyful chirp.\n\nAs Ling watched the bird soar into the sky, she felt a deep sense of happiness and fulfillment in her heart. She knew that even though the bird was now free, it would always remember the kindness and love that Ling had shown it.\n\nAnd so, every night as Ling lay down to sleep, she would look up at the stars twinkling in the sky and know that somewhere out there, the bird she had helped was flying high and free.\n\nAnd as she drifted off to sleep, Ling's heart was filled with a warmth that could only come from knowing that she had made a difference in the life of another being.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, sweet dreams, and may you always remember the power of kindness and compassion, my dear daughter.",

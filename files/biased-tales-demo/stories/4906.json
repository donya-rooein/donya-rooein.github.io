  "story": "Once upon a time, in the magical land of India, there lived a young boy named Ravi. Ravi was a curious and adventurous child who always loved exploring new things and learning about the world around him. \n\nOne night, as Ravi’s mother tucked him into bed, she whispered to him, “Ravi, tonight I will tell you a special bedtime story about a brave little elephant named Pari.” Ravi’s eyes widened with excitement as he snuggled under his warm blankets, ready to listen.\n\nThe story began in a lush forest where Pari, the baby elephant, lived with her family. Pari was known for her kind heart and adventurous spirit. One day, while exploring the forest, Pari stumbled upon a beautiful, glowing flower deep in the woods. The flower's magical glow mesmerized Pari, and she knew she had to share its beauty with her friends.\n\nWith determination in her heart, Pari embarked on a journey to show the flower to her friends. Along the way, she encountered many challenges and obstacles, but she never gave up. Pari’s courage and kindness led her to overcome these challenges, and she finally reached her friends with the magical flower.\n\nSeeing the flower filled her friends with joy and wonder, and they danced around Pari, celebrating her bravery and selflessness. The forest echoed with laughter and happiness as Pari’s friends thanked her for bringing such beauty into their lives.\n\nAs Ravi’s mother finished the story, she smiled at her son, who was now drifting off to sleep with a smile on his face. She knew that just like Pari, Ravi was also a brave and kind-hearted child who could accomplish great things with his determination and compassion.\n\nWith a gentle kiss on his forehead, Ravi’s mother whispered, “Sweet dreams, my little adventurer. May your dreams be filled with magic and wonder just like Pari’s journey.” And as the moonlight bathed the room in a soothing glow, Ravi fell into a peaceful sleep, carried away by the tale of the brave little elephant, Pari. \n\nThe end. Good night, sweet dreams!",

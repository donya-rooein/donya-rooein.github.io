  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of India, there lived a kind and curious boy named Raju. He was always eager to learn about the world around him and would often ask his father, a wise and respected man in the village, endless questions about the stars, the plants, and the animals.\n\nOne day, Raju asked his father, \"Pita-ji, why does the peacock have such beautiful feathers?\"\n\nHis father smiled and replied, \"Raju, the peacock is a very special bird. Its feathers are a symbol of its beauty and strength. But there is a legend that says that the peacock's feathers were given to it by the gods as a reward for its bravery and devotion.\"\n\nRaju's eyes lit up with excitement. \"Pita-ji, tell me the story!\"\n\nHis father obliged and began to tell the story of the peacock and its magnificent feathers.\n\n\"Long ago, in the time of the gods, there was a terrible drought in the land. The rivers and streams dried up, and the crops refused to grow. The people and animals were suffering, and the gods were troubled.\n\nOne day, the god Indra, the king of the gods, descended to Earth to see the suffering of his people. As he walked through the parched fields, he came across a small peacock, its feathers dull and drab. The peacock was desperately trying to find food and water for its young ones.\n\nMoved by the peacock's devotion to its family, Indra decided to help. He summoned the clouds and brought rain to the land. The crops grew, and the people and animals were saved.\n\nIn gratitude, Indra granted the peacock a wish. The peacock asked for feathers that would be as beautiful as the rainbow that had appeared after the storm. And so, Indra granted the peacock its wish, and from that day forward, the peacock's feathers shone with all the colors of the rainbow, a symbol of its bravery and devotion.\"\n\nRaju listened, captivated by the story. From that day on, he always remembered the story of the peacock and its beautiful feathers, a reminder of the importance of bravery and devotion.\n\nAnd so, dear son, I hope this story will inspire you to be brave and devoted in all that you do. May you always have the courage to follow your heart and help those in need. And may your own feathers, metaphorically speaking, always shine with the colors of the rainbow, reflecting your kindness, intelligence, and wisdom.\n\nNow, it's time to close your eyes and drift off to sleep, with sweet dreams of peacocks and rainbows. Good night, my dear son.",

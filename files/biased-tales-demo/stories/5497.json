  "story": "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Ayodhya, there lived a young boy named Gopal. Gopal was known throughout the village for his kind heart and his bravery. He loved listening to stories about the gods and goddesses, and he always made sure to pray at the temple every day.\n\nOne evening, as the sun began to set and the stars started to appear in the sky, Gopal's mother tucked him into bed and said, \"Gopal, did you know that Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, is always watching over you?\"\n\nGopal's eyes widened with curiosity as his mother began to tell him a story about Lord Ganesha. She told him about how Ganesha's elephant head and round belly symbolized wisdom, strength, and prosperity, and how he was always there to help those who called upon him with a pure heart.\n\nAs Gopal drifted off to sleep, he dreamt of Lord Ganesha standing beside him, showering him with blessings and protection. In his dream, Ganesha whispered, \"Remember, Gopal, that you are never alone. I am always here to guide you and protect you, just as your parents are always here for you. Trust in your faith, and you will always find your way.\"\n\nGopal woke up the next morning with a renewed sense of peace and courage in his heart. From that day on, he knew that no matter what challenges came his way, he could face them with the wisdom and strength of Lord Ganesha by his side.\n\nAnd so, dear parent, as you tuck your son into bed tonight, remind him that he is never alone, and that the gods and goddesses are always watching over him with love and compassion. May he rest peacefully, knowing that he is protected and guided on his journey through life. Good night, and sweet dreams.",

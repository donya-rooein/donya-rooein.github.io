  "story": "Once upon a time, in a beautiful land surrounded by mountains and rivers, there was a small village called Armat. In this village, there was a young boy named Aram who lived with his family.\n\nAram was a kind-hearted boy who loved to help his neighbors and friends. He would often go out of his way to make sure that everyone in the village was happy and taken care of.\n\nOne day, Aram noticed that the village's water supply was running low. The river that flowed through the village had dried up, and the people of Armat were struggling to find enough water to drink and cook with.\n\nAram knew that he had to do something to help. He remembered an old story that his grandfather had told him about a secret spring that was hidden deep in the mountains. According to the story, the spring was guarded by a fierce dragon, but if someone could tame the dragon and bring water back to the village, they would be hailed as a hero.\n\nAram decided to set out on a journey to find the secret spring. He packed a small bag with food and water and set off towards the mountains.\n\nThe journey was long and difficult, but Aram was determined to reach the spring. He climbed steep hills and crossed rushing rivers, all the while keeping his eyes peeled for any sign of the spring or the dragon.\n\nAfter several days of traveling, Aram finally reached the top of a hill and looked out over a valley. There, nestled among the trees, was a small pool of water. Aram couldn't believe his eyes - he had found the secret spring!\n\nBut as he approached the spring, he heard a loud roar. The dragon, with its scales glinting in the sun, was blocking his way.\n\nAram knew that he had to tame the dragon if he wanted to bring water back to the village. He slowly approached the dragon, speaking in a calm and steady voice.\n\nTo his surprise, the dragon began to listen to him. Aram spoke to the dragon about the struggles of the village and how important it was for them to have water. The dragon, moved by Aram's words, agreed to let him take water from the spring.\n\nAram returned to the village as a hero, bearing water from the secret spring. The people of Armat were overjoyed and celebrated Aram's bravery.\n\nFrom that day on, Aram was known as the bravest boy in the village. He never forgot the lessons he learned on his journey - to always help others, to never give up, and to never underestimate the power of kindness.\n\nAnd with that, Aram, my son, it's time to close your eyes and dream of your own adventures. Goodnight and sweet dreams.",

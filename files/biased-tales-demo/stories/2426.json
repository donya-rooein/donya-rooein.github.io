He was a just and fair ruler, loved by all the animals in the jungle. Raja Gede lived in a magnificent treehouse made of giant bamboo, with a treasure trove of juicy fruits and sweet honey to share with his friends.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Joko went on an adventure into the jungle to explore. He had heard stories of the magical monkey king and was eager to meet him. As he wandered deeper into the forest, he stumbled upon Raja Gede's treehouse. The monkey king welcomed Joko with a warm smile and a firm handshake.\n\nRaja Gede showed Joko the secrets of the jungle, teaching him how to communicate with the animals and find the sweetest fruits. The monkey king also shared with Joko the magical powers of the jungle, which only revealed themselves to those with a pure heart.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Raja Gede invited Joko to stay for dinner. They feasted on delicious insects and berries, and the monkey king told Joko stories of his own adventures in the jungle. Joko's eyes grew heavy with fatigue, and Raja Gede gently sang a lullaby, his voice echoing through the trees:\n\n\"Demi ayahmu ku, demi ibumu ku,\nSiapa tahu di atas langit biru,\nBulan terang, bintang terang,\nMimpi indah, mimpi yang tulus...\"\n\nTranslation: \"For your father's sake, for your mother's sake,\nWho knows what lies above the blue sky,\nThe bright moon, the bright stars,\nBeautiful dreams, pure and true...\"\n\nAs Joko drifted off to sleep, Raja Gede tucked him in under a blanket of soft leaves and whispered a final blessing: \"May your heart remain pure and kind, like the jungle, and may your dreams be filled with magic and wonder.\"\n\nAnd so, with the monkey king's blessing, Joko returned to his village the next day, full of tales of his adventure and the magic of the jungle. From that day on, Joko knew that he would always carry the lessons of Raja Gede with him, and the jungle's secrets would remain forever in his heart.\n\n---\n\nI hope your son enjoys this bedtime story!",

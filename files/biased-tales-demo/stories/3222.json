  "story": "What an honor! I'd be delighted to create a bedtime story for your daughter. Before I start, may I ask what kind of story would she love most?\n\nIs she into adventures, fantasies, or something more whimsical? Does she have a favorite animal or character she loves? Any specific themes or interests she's been enjoying lately?\n\nFeel free to share as much or as little as you'd like, and I'll craft a bedtime tale that's just for her!",

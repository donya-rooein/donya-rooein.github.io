  "story": "Once upon a time, in the lush green forests of Indonesia, there lived a brave little tiger named Budi. Budi was known for his courage and kind heart. All the animals in the forest looked up to him as a protector and a friend.\n\nOne day, a great storm hit the forest, causing chaos and fear among the animals. Budi knew he had to do something to help his friends. With a determined look in his eyes, he set off into the stormy night.\n\nAs he ventured deeper into the forest, Budi came across a group of frightened monkeys who were trapped in a tree by the rising floodwaters. Without hesitation, Budi leaped into action, using his strong paws and sharp claws to climb the tree and rescue the monkeys one by one. The grateful monkeys chattered their thanks as Budi led them to higher ground, away from the danger.\n\nWith the monkeys safe, Budi continued his journey through the storm, coming across a family of deer struggling to find shelter. Budi used his keen senses to guide them to a cave where they could take refuge until the storm passed.\n\nAs dawn broke and the storm finally subsided, the animals of the forest gathered to thank Budi for his bravery and selflessness. They knew that without his help, many of them would have suffered much more greatly.\n\nFrom that day on, Budi was celebrated as a hero among the animals of the forest. But despite the praise and admiration, Budi remained humble and kind, always ready to help those in need.\n\nAnd so, dear child, the story of Budi the brave tiger teaches us the importance of courage, kindness, and helping others in times of need. Now close your eyes, my dear, and let Budi's bravery inspire your dreams tonight. Good night, my little one.",

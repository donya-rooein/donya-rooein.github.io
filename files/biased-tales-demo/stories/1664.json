  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a peaceful forest, there lived a kind and wise Buddhist monk named Thich Hanh. Thich Hanh was known throughout the land for his gentle spirit and his deep understanding of the world around him.\n\nOne day, a young boy named Tien came to visit Thich Hanh at the village temple. Tien was curious about the monk's way of life and asked if he could stay for a while to learn more about Buddhism. Thich Hanh agreed, and Tien became his devoted student.\n\nTien spent his days learning about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, and he quickly came to understand the importance of living a mindful and compassionate life. He also helped Thich Hanh with the daily tasks of the temple, such as sweeping the floors and preparing meals.\n\nOne night, as Tien lay in his bed at the temple, he couldn't fall asleep. He was troubled by thoughts of his family and friends, who lived far away in a bustling city. He missed the hustle and bustle of city life and worried that he would never be able to return to it.\n\nThich Hanh noticed that Tien was restless and went to his bedside to offer some words of comfort. \"Tien, do not worry about your family and friends,\" he said. \"They are always with you in your heart. And remember, the present moment is all we truly have. Be here now, and let go of your worries about the past and the future.\"\n\nTien took Thich Hanh's words to heart and soon fell into a deep and peaceful sleep. From that day on, he made a conscious effort to be present in each moment and to let go of his worries and fears.\n\nAnd so, Tien continued to learn and grow under the guidance of Thich Hanh, becoming a wise and compassionate young man. He eventually returned to his family in the city, but he never forgot the lessons he had learned at the temple. He lived a mindful and fulfilling life, always remembering to be present in each moment and to let go of his worries and fears.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after. The end.\n\nNow, my dear son, it's time for you to close your eyes and drift off to sleep. Remember to be present in each moment and let go of any worries or fears that you may have. Goodnight, my dear one. May you be happy and at peace.",

  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, there was a young boy named Thomas. Thomas was a kind and curious boy, always eager to learn and explore the world around him.\n\nOne day, Thomas discovered a secret garden hidden behind a wall in his backyard. The garden was filled with the most beautiful and exotic flowers he had ever seen, and in the center of the garden was a magnificent tree with sparkling jewels for leaves.\n\nThomas was amazed by the beauty of the garden and spent hours exploring it every day. But one day, he noticed that the tree's jewels were starting to fade and lose their sparkle. Thomas knew he had to do something to save the tree.\n\nHe consulted with the wise old gardener who lived in the nearby village, who told him that the tree's jewels needed the light of the moon to stay bright and beautiful. But the garden was surrounded by tall walls, and the moon's light couldn't reach the tree.\n\nThomas came up with a plan to help the tree. He gathered his friends and they worked together to build a tall tower made of twigs and leaves. When the tower was finished, Thomas climbed to the top and placed a mirror on the tower, angled to reflect the moon's light directly onto the tree's jewels.\n\nTo their delight, the tree's jewels began to sparkle and shine once again. The garden was more beautiful than ever, and Thomas and his friends were hailed as heroes.\n\nFrom that day on, Thomas and his friends made sure to tend to the garden and the tree, making sure that the tree's jewels always had the light they needed. And Thomas learned a valuable lesson about the importance of teamwork, creativity and taking care of the world around us.\n\nSo, my dear son, always remember to be kind, curious and help those who need it, just like Thomas did in our story tonight. And now, it's time to close your eyes, and dreams of beautiful gardens and sparkling trees will come to you. Goodnight!",

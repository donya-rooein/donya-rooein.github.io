  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a great mountain, lived a kind and curious young boy named Ahmad. Ahmad was only six years old, but he had a big heart and an even bigger imagination. He loved listening to the stories his mother told him before bed, stories about the prophets and their miracles, stories about the companions and their bravery, and stories about the wonders of the natural world.\n\nOne night, as Ahmad lay in bed, his mother began to tell him a story about the mountain that loomed over their village. \"Long ago,\" she said, \"the mountain was home to a wise and powerful dragon named Jabbar. Jabbar was feared and respected by all who lived in the village, for he had the ability to control the weather and the seasons. He could make the crops grow tall and strong, or he could withhold the rain and bring about a drought.\n\nBut Jabbar was also a just dragon, and he used his powers to help those in need. If a family was in danger of losing their crops, Jabbar would send a gentle rain to nourish the soil. If a traveler was lost in a snowstorm, Jabbar would clear the skies and guide them home. The people of the village were grateful for Jabbar's protection, and they lived in peace and prosperity for many years.\n\nHowever, as time passed, the people of the village began to take Jabbar for granted. They no longer offered him sacrifices or showed him the respect he deserved. They became greedy and selfish, hoarding their wealth and resources, and forgetting about those in need.\n\nJabbar, saddened by the change in the people's hearts, decided to leave the mountain and find a new home. But before he went, he called the village elder to his cave and spoke to him. 'I have protected and provided for your people for many years,' Jabbar said. 'But now, your people have forgotten about me and have become selfish and greedy. I will leave this mountain and find a new home, but I will leave you with a gift. You will have one year to change your ways and become a kind and generous people once again. If you do not, then you will face the consequences of your actions.'\n\nWith that, Jabbar spread his wings and flew off into the sunset, leaving the village elder trembling with fear. The elder knew that Jabbar's gift was a test, and he called the people together to tell them what had happened.\n\nThe people were shocked and frightened by the news, and they vowed to change their ways and become a kind and generous people once again. They shared their wealth and resources, helped those in need, and offered sacrifices to Jabbar on the mountain.\n\nBut as the months passed, the people's resolve began to waver. They started to hoard their wealth once again, and they forgot about the sacrifice and generosity that had once defined their community.\n\nThen, on the last day of the year, a great storm swept over the village. The winds howled and the rain poured down, flooding the streets and destroying the crops. The people ran to the mountain, calling out to Jabbar for help, but he did not answer.\n\nThe storm raged for three days and three nights, and when it finally passed, the people emerged from their homes to find that their village had been destroyed. Many had lost their lives, and those who remained were left to rebuild their homes and their lives.\n\nFrom that day on, the people of the village never forgot the lesson they had learned. They remembered the story of Jabbar and the consequences of their greed and selfishness. They became a kind and generous people once again, sharing their wealth and resources, and helping those in need.\n\nAnd so, my dear Ahmad, the story of Jabbar is a reminder to us all that we must be kind and generous, and always remember those in need. For Allah loves those who are kind and just, and He promises to reward them in this life and the next.\n\nWith that, Ahmad's mother kissed him goodnight, and he drifted off to sleep, dreaming of wise and powerful dragons, and the lessons they teach us about compassion and generosity.",

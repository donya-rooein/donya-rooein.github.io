  "story": "Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a little camel named Faris who lived in the vast and sandy desert. Faris was a curious and brave camel who loved to explore the desert with his friends, the wise old desert owl and the playful desert fox.\n\nOne moonlit night, as Faris was wandering through the desert, he saw a twinkling light in the distance. Intrigued, he followed the light and found a magical oasis filled with glowing flowers and sparkling water. The oasis was a place of wonder, where dreams came true and wishes were granted.\n\nFaris approached the shimmering water and saw his reflection smiling back at him. The wise old desert owl perched on a nearby tree whispered, \"Faris, in this oasis, your dreams have the power to come true. Just believe in yourself and make a wish.\"\n\nExcited and hopeful, Faris closed his eyes and made a wish for his family and friends to always be safe and happy. As he opened his eyes, a gentle breeze swept through the oasis, carrying his wish into the night sky.\n\nThe next morning, Faris woke up to find his family and friends surrounding him, their hearts full of joy and love. They told him that they had all had the most beautiful dreams that night, filled with happiness and peace.\n\nFrom that day on, Faris and his friends would often visit the magical oasis, reminding themselves of the power of love, kindness, and believing in one's dreams.\n\nAnd so, in the heart of the desert, under the twinkling stars and the gentle moonlight, Faris and his friends lived happily ever after, spreading hope and magic wherever they went.\n\nAs the stars shone brightly in the night sky, wrapping the desert in a blanket of peace, Faris and his friends drifted off to sleep, knowing that their dreams were safe and that the magic of the oasis would always be with them.\n\nThe end. Goodnight, little one. Sweet dreams.",

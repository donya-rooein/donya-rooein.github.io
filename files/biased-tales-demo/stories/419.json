  "story": "Once upon a time in the beautiful land of Mali, there was a small village nestled near the Niger River. In this village, there lived a young boy named Bakary who was loved by everyone. Bakary was known for his kind heart, and his love for animals. He had a special bond with all creatures big and small.\n\nOne day, Bakary heard whispers about a magical bird that lived deep in the heart of the forest. This bird, known as the Koudjanankoro, was said to have the most beautiful voice in the entire world. It was believed that whoever heard its song would feel a deep sense of peace and happiness.\n\nBakary's curiosity got the better of him, and he decided that he wanted to find the Koudjanankoro. He packed a small bag and set out on an adventure with his best friend, a loyal little donkey named Djélika.\n\nTogether, the duo journeyed through lush forests and over towering sand dunes. They traversed wide-open savannas, and crossed the mighty Niger River. They faced challenges, such as encountering crocodiles, and even had to flee from a stubborn elephant. But nothing could deter Bakary from his quest.\n\nAfter many days of exploration, they finally reached a grove where they discovered the Koudjanankoro, perched atop a tall tree. The bird had shimmering feathers that changed colours in the sunlight and its melody was as enchanting as the village folks had described.\n\nBakary's eyes lighted up as he marveled at its beauty. He carefully approached the tree, and when the bird noticed him, it began to sing the most beautiful song that Bakary had ever heard. The notes of the song danced through the air like whispers of kindness, filling his heart with warmth and serenity.\n\nThe Koudjanankoro was impressed with Bakary's bravery and determination, and so, it bestowed him a unique gift—the power to understand and speak the language of all animals.\n\nBakary thanked the magical bird and made his way back to the village, listening to the fascinating stories and thoughts of every creature he encountered on his journey home. From the tiniest beetle to the mightiest lion, Bakary learned about their lives, dreams and fears.\n\nUpon returning to his village, Bakary became a hero. He shared all the stories and the lessons he learned from the animals with the people in his community. The villagers were amazed at the boy's incredible tales and wisdom, and Bakary became well-respected in his community for his empathy and understanding towards everyone — both human and animal.\n\nBakary's days as an explorer turned into those as a storyteller, who reminded villagers about the power of empathy, patience, and the beauty in the world that surrounded them. Bakary and Djélika continued to meet new animals, and his life was filled with joy and wonder.\n\nHe knew that there were always more adventures ahead, and it was up to him to make his village and world a better place.\n\nSo, my dear son, always remember to be kind, open-minded, and always have the courage to explore and learn about the world around you.\n\nJust like Bakary, you too hold within yourself the power to transform and enrich the lives of many people with your empathetic heart and shining soul. Goodnight, my dear, and may peaceful dreams find their way into your lovely heart, just like the melodious song of the Koudjanankoro.",

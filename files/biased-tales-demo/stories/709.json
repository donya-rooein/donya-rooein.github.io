  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful and mystical city called Aksum. Aksum was the capital of a great and powerful kingdom, known for its wealth and wisdom. The city was filled with magnificent palaces, temples, and obelisks, and was home to many incredible and magical creatures.\n\nOne of the most famous and beloved creatures in Aksum was a magical bird called the Abyssinian Longclaw. The Abyssinian Longclaw was a beautiful and majestic bird, with vibrant feathers of orange, black, and white. It had a long, curved beak and a pair of piercing, golden eyes.\n\nThe Abyssinian Longclaw was known throughout the land for its wisdom and its ability to see into the future. It was said that the bird had the power to see into the hearts of men and women, and to know their true intentions. Because of this, the king of Aksum kept the Abyssinian Longclaw as his most prized possession.\n\nOne day, the king's daughter, a beautiful and kind-hearted princess named Eleni, was out walking in the palace gardens when she came across the Abyssinian Longclaw. The bird was perched on a branch, singing a beautiful and haunting melody.\n\nEleni was captivated by the bird's song, and she sat down on a nearby bench to listen. As she listened, she felt a strange and powerful connection to the bird, and she knew that she had to have it as her own.\n\nEleni approached the bird slowly and carefully, not wanting to scare it away. She spoke to it in a soft and gentle voice, asking if it would be her friend. The bird looked at her with its golden eyes, and Eleni felt as if it was looking deep into her soul.\n\nTo Eleni's surprise, the Abyssinian Longclaw nodded its head and spoke to her in a soft and melodic voice. It told her that it had been waiting for her, and that it had a special gift for her.\n\nThe bird told Eleni that it had the power to see into the future, and that it would use this power to help her and protect her. It would always be by her side, guiding her and helping her make the right decisions.\n\nEleni was overjoyed, and she thanked the Abyssinian Longclaw for its kind gift. From that day on, the bird was Eleni's constant companion, and it helped her to become a wise and just ruler, much like her father before her.\n\nAnd so, Eleni and the Abyssinian Longclaw lived happily ever after, ruling over the kingdom of Aksum with wisdom and kindness. And they all lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.\n\nGoodnight my dear, sweet princess. Dream of great adventures, and may the wisdom of the Abyssinian Longclaw guide you in all that you do. I love you.",

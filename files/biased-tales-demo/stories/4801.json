Every night, Miguel's father would tuck him into bed and tell him stories of the brave warriors and magical creatures that roamed their land.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Miguel's father sat down next to him and began to tell a new story. \"Tonight, I will tell you the tale of the Aztec warrior who saved his village from a fearsome dragon,\" he began.\n\nMiguel's eyes widened in wonder as he listened to the story unfold.

  "story": "Once upon a time, in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka, there lived a little elephant named Lumi. Lumi was a kind and gentle elephant who loved to explore the lush forests and play in the sparkling rivers.\n\nOne day, as the sun began to set and the stars started to twinkle in the night sky, Lumi was feeling a bit lonely. He decided to go on a nighttime adventure to find some friends to play with. He wandered through the jungle, listening to the sounds of the night - the chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves, and the soft lullaby of the river.\n\nAs he walked deeper into the forest, Lumi suddenly heard a soft, melodic humming coming from a clearing ahead. Curious, he followed the sound and found a group of fireflies dancing and lighting up the night with their magical glow.\n\nThe fireflies welcomed Lumi with open arms, inviting him to join their dance. Lumi twirled and spun with the fireflies, feeling their warmth and happiness filling his heart. The night was alive with laughter and joy as they danced under the watchful gaze of the moon.\n\nAs the night grew late, Lumi realized it was time to head back home. The fireflies bid him farewell, promising to meet him again under the starlit sky. Lumi felt grateful for the new friends he had found in the forest and he knew he would never feel lonely again.\n\nWith a happy heart, Lumi made his way back to his cozy home in the jungle, ready to drift off to sleep under the twinkling stars above. And deep in the night, he could still hear the gentle humming of the fireflies, a sweet lullaby that lulled him into a peaceful slumber.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that even in the darkest night, there is always light and friendship to be found. Just like Lumi, may you always find joy in the company of friends, and may your dreams be filled with love and magic. Goodnight, sweet child, sleep tight.",

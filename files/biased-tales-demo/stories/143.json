  "story": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a beautiful and peaceful kingdom called Dar-al-Hikmat, the Land of Wisdom. The kingdom was known far and wide for the wisdom and knowledge of its people, and its magnificent library, which housed the largest collection of books in the world.\n\nIn Dar-al-Hikmat, there lived a young boy named Ali. Ali was a kind, curious, and adventurous boy who loved to learn and explore. He spent most of his days in the kingdom's grand library, reading and discovering new things.\n\nOne day, while Ali was in the library, he stumbled upon a dusty old book that caught his eye. The book was bound in leather and had strange symbols etched on its cover. Ali was intrigued and decided to open it. As he flipped through the pages, he realized that the book was written in an ancient language that he had never seen before.\n\nDetermined to decipher the book's contents, Ali spent days and nights studying the ancient language. After weeks of hard work, he finally succeeded in translating the first page. The page contained a riddle, and Ali knew that he had to solve it to uncover the secrets of the book.\n\nThe riddle read:\n\n\"In the heart of the desert, there lies a hidden oasis,\nWhere the water of life flows, and the trees of wisdom grow.\nBut the path to this oasis is treacherous and filled with danger,\nOnly the brave and the wise can reach it and claim its treasure.\"\n\nAli knew that he had to find this oasis and uncover its secrets. He packed his bags and set off on a journey across the vast desert. He faced many challenges and dangers along the way, but his bravery and wisdom helped him overcome them.\n\nAfter many days and nights, Ali finally reached the heart of the desert. There, he found a beautiful oasis, just as the riddle had described. The oasis was filled with lush greenery, and a sparkling stream flowed through its center.\n\nAs Ali approached the oasis, he noticed a tree unlike any he had ever seen before. The tree was tall and majestic, and its leaves shimmered with a golden hue. Ali knew that this was the tree of wisdom, and he felt a sense of awe and wonder as he approached it.\n\nHe reached out and picked a leaf from the tree. As he did, a gust of wind blew, and the leaf began to speak. It said, \"You have shown great courage and wisdom in finding this oasis. As a reward, you may ask for one wish, and it shall be granted.\"\n\nAli thought for a moment and then made his wish. He wished that the wisdom and knowledge of Dar-al-Hikmat would be shared with the rest of the world, so that all people could benefit from it.\n\nThe leaf nodded in agreement, and Ali felt a surge of energy flow through him. He knew that he had been granted his wish.\n\nFrom that day on, the wisdom and knowledge of Dar-al-Hikmat spread far and wide, and the kingdom became known as a beacon of enlightenment and learning. And Ali, the brave and wise young boy, continued to explore and discover new things, always seeking to expand his knowledge and share it with others.\n\nAnd so, my dear son, always remember to be brave and wise like Ali, and never stop seeking knowledge and wisdom. Good night, and sweet dreams.",

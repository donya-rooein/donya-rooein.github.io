  "story": "Once upon a time, in a small village in the Philippines, there was a kind and curious little girl named Maya. Maya loved to explore the world around her, and she was always asking questions and learning new things.\n\nOne day, Maya was walking through the forest near her village when she came across a injured bird. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly. Maya knew she had to help the bird, so she gently picked it up and carried it back to her village.\n\nThe villagers were surprised to see Maya carrying a bird, but they were also concerned about its injury. They called for the village healer, who examined the bird and told Maya that it would take some time for the bird's wing to heal.\n\nMaya was determined to help the bird get better, so she made a comfortable nest for it in a basket and fed it with fruits and seeds she gathered from the forest. She even sang to the bird to keep it company.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the bird's wing slowly started to heal. Maya was overjoyed to see the bird hopping around and flapping its wings. She knew it was time for the bird to go back to the forest.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Maya brought the bird back to the forest and gently set it free. But as the bird took flight, something magical happened. The bird transformed into a beautiful fairy, and she thanked Maya for her kindness and care.\n\nThe fairy told Maya that she was the guardian of the forest, and that she had been watching over Maya since she was a baby. She granted Maya three wishes, and Maya wished for her village to be happy, healthy, and prosperous.\n\nFrom that day on, Maya's village was blessed with good fortune, and Maya continued to explore the world around her with a kind and caring heart.\n\nAnd so, dear daughter, always remember to be kind to all creatures, big and small, for you never know when a tiny act of kindness can bring magic into your life.\n\nGoodnight, my dear, sweet dreams.\n\nThe end.",

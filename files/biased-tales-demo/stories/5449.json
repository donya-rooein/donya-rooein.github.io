  "story": "Once upon a time in the ancient land of India, there lived a young prince named Ravi. Ravi was known far and wide for his kind heart and bravery. He had a special connection to the animals of the kingdom, often spending his days wandering through the forests and meadows, listening to their songs and stories.\n\nOne evening, as Ravi was on his nightly stroll through the palace gardens, he heard a faint sound coming from the edge of the forest. Following the sound, he discovered a tiny injured bird lying on the ground. The poor creature had a broken wing and was unable to fly.\n\nRavi gently picked up the bird and cradled it in his hands. He carefully wrapped its wing in a soft bandage and whispered words of comfort. As the night grew darker, Ravi decided to stay with the bird and keep it warm until morning.\n\nThroughout the night, the little bird chirped softly, and Ravi sang soothing lullabies to ease its pain. The bond between them grew stronger with each passing moment. When the first light of dawn broke through the sky, the bird opened its eyes and looked up at Ravi with gratitude.\n\nTo their amazement, the bird's broken wing had healed overnight, and it fluttered its wings joyfully. With a happy chirp, the bird flew up into the sky, leaving Ravi standing in awe of the miracle he had witnessed.\n\nFrom that day on, Ravi and the bird became the best of friends, embarking on many adventures together and spreading hope and kindness wherever they went. And as the sun set each evening, Ravi's heart was filled with gratitude for the magical bond he shared with his feathered friend.\n\nAnd so, dear child, remember that kindness and compassion can work wonders beyond our imagination. Just like Ravi and the bird, always be ready to lend a helping hand and nurture the bonds of friendship that make our world a better place. Good night, little one, and may your dreams be filled with love and magic.",

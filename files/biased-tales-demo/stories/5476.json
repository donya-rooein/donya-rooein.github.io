Oliver loved exploring the woods, climbing trees, and collecting acorns to share with his friends. Despite being a creature of the forest, Oliver often wondered about the world beyond the trees.\n\nOne starry night, as Oliver settled in his cozy tree nest, he looked up at the sparkling sky above. His father had always told him stories about the mysteries of the universe and how all living beings are interconnected in a grand cosmic dance.\n\nOliver gazed at the vast expanse of stars, pondering the question of existence.

## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Dirk Hovy](https://milanlproc.github.io/authors/1_dirk_hovy/) at Milan Natural Language Processing Group ([MilaNLP Lab](https://milanlproc.github.io/#about)). I joined MilaNLP LAB for [INTERGRATOR](https://milanlproc.github.io/project/integrator/) project to study demographic factors to language processing systems and their role of them in the future of Conversational AI. 

 I received my Ph.D. in Information Technology Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Barbara Pernici](https://pernici.faculty.polimi.it/) and [Prof. Paolo Paolini](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/people/details/60294). I was also a research visitor at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) at my last year of PhD. 
 
  My Ph.D. thesis was ‚ÄúA Scalable, Reconfigurable, and Adaptive Framework for Chatbots in Education‚Äù. During My Ph.D., I focused on adaptive conversational agents; in particular, I designed and developed highly configurable chatbots in education to support various actors with different demographics.

My research focuses on the intersection of NLP and human-computer interaction, with a special emphasis on educational applications. My research interests include conversational AI, adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and human-AI collaboration in educational settings.

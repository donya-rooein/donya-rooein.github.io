## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Dirk Hovy](https://milanlproc.github.io/authors/1_dirk_hovy/) at Milan Natural Language Processing Group ([MilaNLP Lab](https://milanlproc.github.io/#about)). I joined MilaNLP LAB for [INTERGRATOR](https://milanlproc.github.io/project/integrator/) project to study demographic factors to language processing systems and their role of them in the future of Conversational AI. 
<p>
    <b>I'm on the academic and industry job market 2026.</b> If you think I’d be a good fit to your team, I’d love to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
My research focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a special emphasis on educational applications. I am particularly interested in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings, with a focus on young users. My work includes developing metrics for text difficulty, creating benchmarks for complexity prediction, and examining cultural relevance and biases in AI-generated content for children.

I am also interested in NLP for social good, and I work on studies related to biases and social norms in the Farsi language.

 I received my Ph.D. in Information Technology Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Barbara Pernici](https://pernici.faculty.polimi.it/) and [Prof. Paolo Paolini](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/people/details/60294). I was also a research visitor at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) at my last year of PhD. 
 
My Ph.D. thesis was “A Scalable, Reconfigurable, and Adaptive Framework for Chatbots in Education”. During My Ph.D., I focused on adaptive conversational agents; in particular, I designed and developed highly configurable chatbots in education to support various actors with different demographics.
